Trump's budget is immoral and it must be soundly defeated. 
What a disgrace.
Reminder: This is how Republicans celebrated when they passed this bill that takes health care away from 23 million Americans. 
"LIVE: Sen. Sanders’ response to the CBO score of the Republican health care plan
"
A “health care” plan does not throw 23 million people off of health care. That’s a “destroy health care” plan.
Please do not call this a health care bill. This is a disgrace. 
Joining @chrislhayes tonight: @SenSanders @JRubinBlogger @SteveRattner @karoun @Isikoff #KennethMcCallion @EvelynNFarkas @tomricks1 #inners
Trump's immoral and pathetic budget would take a major step forward in enacting the Koch brothers’ right wing agenda. 
"Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed, house and educate 15 million people?"
Has the administration estimated how many people would die if 23 million Americans are thrown off of health insurance? 
"We cannot rest until every worker in America has the right to make at least $15 an hour.
 "
"I know a $15 minimum wage is radical to Republicans.

You know what’s radical? That people working 40 or 50 hours a week live in poverty."
@SenSanders @SenSchumer Millions of women and men across the country are unable to support their families earning the current minimum wage. #RaiseTheWage 
"President Trump’s budget is immoral and must be defeated, Sen. Bernie Sanders says, writing for @CNNOpinion  "
"A few years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 was “crazy.” But millions of workers refused to take “no” for an answer. "
"Whether you’re a CEO or a janitor, ALL Americans who work full-time deserve a living wage. Joining @PattyMurray @SenSanders to #RaiseTheWage"
I asked Trump's budget director a very simple question: Why do billionaires need tax breaks at the expense of working families? 
Raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give more than 41 million low-wage workers a raise. #RaiseTheWage 
I was proud to join @PattyMurray &amp; @SenSanders to introduce a bill to raise the federal #minimumwage for Americans 
I want to commend Republican @JoeNBC for asking why his own party continues to lie about its plan to cut Medicaid by $850 billion. 
"This is what oligarchy and austerity are about. The public sector is being starved, while billionaires get tax cuts. "
"#BCGrad2017: Introducing our Keynote Speaker, and Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters recipient, Sen. @BernieSanders:  "
My condolences go to the families of the incredibly brave men who stood up for what America is supposed to be about. They are true heroes.

"Sen. Sanders is delivering the keynote address at Brooklyn College 2017 Commencement this morning. Watch here:
"
Increasing our military budget and cutting back on helping poor people around the world is short-sighted and counterproductive. 
My message to the graduates of Brooklyn College today was very simple: Help us create the nation that we all know we can become. 
"If President Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, it will be a horrific mistake."
"No matter what Trump says or does, the people of the United States and the world will not turn their backs on this crisis."
We must continue to work to aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels to sustainable energy and energy efficiency.
"Very inspiring. Everyone should read this story.
"
"I grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn in a three and a half room rent-controlled apartment and we never had a whole lot of money. "
"To the people of Germany and elsewhere in the world: Please don't think that President Trump represents American values, he doesn't. "
Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement is an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace.
"When climate change is already causing devastating harm, we don't have the moral right to turn our backs on efforts to preserve this planet."
What President Trump did today by withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord is an international disgrace. 
"Despite Trump's view that he knows more than the scientific community, we will move forward to combat the crisis of climate change. "
"Yesterday, the U.S. joined Syria and Nicaragua as the third country in the world to reject the Paris climate agreement. What a disgrace. "
"We cannot be 'America first,' or 'Germany first.' We all have our own interests, but we must be an international community. "
I'm discussing voting rights and campaign finance reform with expert @rickhasen 
"You cannot run a government, you cannot make public policy with ""alternative facts."" "
A political revolution is not going to happen overnight. You don't win on your first shot. But is the momentum with us? Damn right it is. 
"ICYMI: Full Bernie Sanders Interview with Me on Voter Fraud, Campaign Finance Reform, and Gerrymandering "
"Congratulations to Kansas for voting to roll back outrageous tax cuts for the wealthy that devastated the state.
"
On a day when Iran has been attacked by ISIS now is not the time to go forward with legislation calling for sanctions against Iran. 
We shouldn’t be selling our infrastructure to billionaires to make huge profits on the backs of working people. 
"While President Trump continues to reject science, these young people are fighting for the future of the planet. "
Donald Trump’s so-called infrastructure plan is a huge giveaway to Wall Street that will fail to modernize our crumbling infrastructure. 
"We must find ways to push back against Iran’s provocative and destructive behavior, but threatening the nuclear deal isn't the way to do it."
What we learned from Comey was deeply troubling. I'm more concerned than ever about Trump’s attempts to derail the Russia investigation.
"Unfortunately, most people would agree with Mr. Comey. On issue after issue after issue, Trump has blatantly lied. "
The American people routinely have to pay outrageous prices for vaccines they paid to develop. That must change. 
"LIVE: Join me and former Ohio state senator @ninaturner, live from The People's Summit in Chicago:

"BREAKING: Senate Republicans just released the schedule of hearings, committee markups and public testimony for their health care bill. "
Also included in this public release: The bill text. 
"When a promise is made to the working people of this country with respect to their pension benefits, that promise cannot be broken. "
It’s time to make it legal for Americans to order prescription drugs from abroad. – @pharmalot 
.@stevenmnuchin1 do you really think it makes sense to cut programs for working families to give huge tax breaks to the Koch brothers' kids?
Sec. Mnuchin just said Trump didn't want to reinstate Glass-Steagall. That's not what Sean Spicer said. 
While Americans are dying because they can't afford their medications the 5 largest drug companies made over $50 billion in profits in 2015.
It’s long past time that we took a very hard look at our relationship with Saudi Arabia. 
Cutting life or death programs in order to give huge tax cuts to the top 1% isn’t a tough decision. It’s an immoral decision. 
"I say to Republicans: If you can’t defend your efforts to throw millions off health care to give huge tax breaks to the top 2%, give it up. "
Jeff Sessions' appearance raised more questions than answers about Trump and whether he has tried to derail the Russia investigation. 
"For the sake of our country and the world, the Democratic Party, in a very fundamental way, must change direction. "
Why won’t Republicans hold hearings on their health care bill? Maybe they know Americans will ask why they take health care from millions. 
"Our prayers go out for a full recovery of Rep. Scalise, the congressional aides and police who were injured. We’ve got to stop the violence."
Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. 
".@SenSanders statement that alleged shooter was presidential campaign volunteer: ""I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms."" "
I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. 
"In the year 2017, we should not continue to trample on Native American sovereignty. The fight against this dangerous pipeline is not over. "
I believe that these new sanctions against Iran could endanger the very important nuclear agreement. That is not a risk worth taking. 
I strongly support imposing sanctions on Russia. It's unacceptable for Russia to interfere in foreign elections. There must be consequences.
Why do we continue to sell billions of arms to Saudi Arabia and give a pass to a monarchy that perpetuates the devastating war in Yemen? 
"Trump campaigned on reinstating Glass-Steagall, now all of the sudden, his Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin tells us that's not the case. "
"If Republicans can’t explain their efforts to throw millions off health insurance, then they need to give it up. "
SUNDAY: We'll talk about the upcoming healthcare battle in the senate with @SenSanders. Don't miss it!  
Our criminal justice system is profoundly broken and has failed African Americans over and over again. 
"We need major reforms including making certain that lethal force is the last response, not the first response."
"We must demand a justice system that values black lives, not one that takes innocent black lives."
The Republicans' health care bill is so bad that they want to keep it secret and at the last second rush it to a vote.  Unacceptable. 
Join @SenWarren and me for a Facebook Live conversation today at 3:30 pm EST on Republicans' health care plan. 
"Mr. Trump, listen to the stories of people like Erykiah. Do you really think cutting her Medicaid is a good idea? "
Health care for 23 million Americans is on the line in the next 2 weeks. Join @SenSanders &amp; me for this powerfully important discussion. 
"Republicans won’t say what’s in their health care plan, so at 3:30 ET @SenWarren and I will take your questions at  "
"We must do everything we can to stop Republicans from throwing 23 million off health insurance.
"
"LIVE: Bernie and Elizabeth Warren discuss the Republican health care plan and take your questions:
 "
"The reason Republicans don't want to bring their health care plan public is because it is a disastrous bill.
"
"You shouldn’t have to choose between your insulin, your food and your rent. Not in America.
"
"Forget ""Trump TV,"" @SenSanders is quietly building one of the most powerful media outfits in America, by me "
"On an issue that impacts tens of millions of people, Republicans don't have the guts to let their health care bill come up for debate."
"I’m speaking on the Senate floor to say to the Republican leadership: what are you afraid of? Bring the bill out.
"
This health care bill will impact millions and millions of Americans. Yet we have not had one hearing. Republicans should be embarrassed.
"The truth is that this is not a ""health care"" bill. This is a ""tax breaks for the rich and multinational corporations"" bill."
"Apply to be an intern in Sen. Sanders’ office this fall. The deadline to apply is Friday, June 23. "
"While Republicans secretly negotiate their health care bill, let’s look back to the debate over Obamacare in 2009 and 2010."
"Obamacare had roundtables, walkthroughs, consideration of over 300 amendments, and 53 hearings in the Finance committee."
We spent 25 consecutive days in session on health reform debating Obamacare. That was the second longest session in Senate history.
"And oddly enough, many of my Republican colleagues said that it was so important and would impact so many people that we needed more time!"
Here’s what Senator Alexander said back then: 
And here is what Senator Hatch had to say: 
The same Republicans now think it's fine for their health care bill to be written behind closed doors without a single committee hearing.
I can understand why Republicans don’t want open discussion. The bill they are working on would do incalculable harm to Americans all over.
"How is it a ""health care"" bill when it throws 23 million people off insurance? Cuts $834 billion from Medicaid? Defunds Planned Parenthood?"
Republicans' process is shameful. It is unacceptable. They owe Americans more. Their plan must never become law.
New on the podcast: Bernie and @SenWarren take questions about the disastrous Republican health care plan: 
God only knows what cutting Medicaid by $800 billion would do to the children and people with disabilities living in this country. 
The House passed health care bill is the worst piece of legislation I have seen in my lifetime. 
I had the pleasure of sitting down with my good friend @SenWarren to discuss the secret Republican health care plan. 
Tomorrow-@SenSanders discusses threats to global democracy at Carnegie. Watch the livestream at 11 a.m.:  #BernieCEIP 
We are not going back to the days when being a woman was considered a pre-existing condition.

The women of America deserve better than 13 male senators deciding the future of their health care behind closed doors.
28 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions more are under-insured. We absolutely cannot let more people lose insurance
I can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump. 
Tune in today at 11 AM for my speech on the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S. and around the world.  
Starting soon--@SenSanders delivers remarks on global democracy. Watch live:  
The bill Republicans announced today is even worse than expected and by far the most harmful piece of legislation I've seen in my lifetime. 
Republicans want to throw millions of Americans off of health insurance while providing over $200 billion in tax breaks to the top 2%.
Our job now is to rally millions of Americans against this disastrous bill to make sure that it does not pass the Senate.
Sen. Sanders speaking now at @CarnegieEndow on the rise of authoritarianism in the US and around the world. 
We must do everything we can to preserve our democracy and oppose the current drift toward authoritarianism Trump represents. #BernieCEIP
There should be widespread concern not only with Trump’s attacks on the media but with his disregard for separation of powers. #BernieCEIP
It is rather strange that our president seems more comfortable with autocrats and authoritarians than democratic leaders. #BernieCEIP
"We should take this pathetic health care bill, throw it in the garbage can and do something that will work for ordinary Americans instead."
I hope Mitch McConnell listened to what the demonstrators had to say outside his office today. 
"joining me now for an intv on health care, @SenSanders @AC360"
We cannot be a country that throws our elderly people out on the streets. 
.@SenSanders tells @SenCapito to vote against the Republican health care bill 
.@SenSanders appeared tonight in Charleston and urged @SenCapito to vote against the Senate's ACA replacement bill. 
".@senrobportman, listen to your own governor, John Kasich. Do not vote to take Medicaid from 360,000 of your constituents. "
Bernie Sanders rallies opposition to Republican healthcare reform plan 
"Senator Capito: Do not vote to throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance - including 122,000 in your own state. "
"This bill is immoral. All of us, including Republicans whose constituents depend on Medicaid to survive, must work to defeat this bill. "
This is what Republicans said about their bill over the weekend. What will they say now that we know 22 million will lose health insurance? 
Health care is a human right.
"Speaking now about the Republican ""health care"" plan that takes insurance from 22 million Americans. "
"Given the crisis we have in primary health care, we must act immediately and boldly. We must expand community health centers. "
The Medicaid expansion saved Rusty Williams' life. Republicans should listen to the stories of people who need Medicaid to live in dignity. 
This is a major victory but it's temporary. Our job now is to rally the American people to stop this awful legislation once and for all! 
"Our job now is to make sure that 100% of the American people know what’s in the disastrous Republican ""health care"" bill. "
"My hope is that the Republican leadership will examine these studies and junk their current ""health care"" bill. "
Sen. Rand Paul and I have very different ideas on providing health care in this country. 
"We will not rest until we’re sure Republicans’ immoral, unconscionable ""health care” bill never sees the light of day in the Senate."
"Everyone knows that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. Our job now is to improve it, not destroy it."
"Thousands of Ohioans know how disastrous the Republican ""health care"" bill would be for their state. "
"Instead of throwing 22M Americans off health care, we should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care as a right."
Any Republican who votes for the health care bill should be ashamed. They are voting to throw their constituents off insurance.
"If one person loses their insurance because of the Republican health care plan, that's too many. But 22 million? That’s an abomination."
"The Republicans' disgraceful ""health care"" bill would do devastating harm to the people of West Virginia and the rest of the United States. "
"The Trump-McConnell “health care” bill would slash Medicaid by $2.4 trillion over the next two decades, devastating tens of millions. "
CBO report shows the Republican health care bill will just get worse with age. @SenSanders reacts:  #inners
We’re not going backwards on women’s health care and women’s rights. No cuts to Planned Parenthood.
"The Republican plan to throw 22 million people off of health care sure is a strange way to improve people's ""access"" to health care."
American healthcare is in crisis. We must fight for the real needs of the people | Bernie Sanders and James Clyburn 
Republicans talk a lot about freedom and choice. But you cannot truly be free if you can't afford health care or food or medicine.
NEWS: Sanders to Sen. Alexander: “Let's End Backroom Deals” 
Remember when $15 an hour was radical? Not so radical anymore thanks to people fighting for a living wage. Congratulations Minneapolis! 
"We do not need to throw 22 million off health insurance. We need Medicare-for-all, and I will introduce that as soon as this debate is over."
"In the short-term, to improve the Affordable Care Act, we should have a public option in 50 states and lower the Medicare age to 55."
"Fox News may not like it, but these are the facts: Thousands of our fellow Americans will die if the Republican health care bill is passed. "
Wishing a safe and happy Independence Day to all. 
Republicans should listen to the stories of people like Brenda Dare who need Medicaid to live in dignity. 
The United States is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Our people should not have to beg for their right to health care.
A great nation is not judged by its number of billionaires or corporate tax breaks. It's judged by how we treat our most vulnerable people.
"As President Trump attends the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, this week, there are three items that should be at the top of his agenda."
1) Growing global economic inequality. The G20 has a major role to play in making sure the benefits of growth benefit all humanity.
2) North Korea. Trump should use the G20 to develop a consensus. Real leadership is bringing parties together to de-escalate tensions.
3) Russia’s meddling in our election. When Trump meets with Putin he must make clear interference is unacceptable &amp; must never happen again.
It is unconscionable that millions of people in the world’s richest country are one diagnosis or car accident away from financial disaster.
"""To constantly wake up to the news that someone is trying to take away my health care, it's just devastating."" - Jasmine Jennings "
This is not Bernie Sanders talking. Listen to what George W. Bush's former ethics lawyer has to say about Trump Jr.'s meeting. 
The only way to confront the serious challenges we face as a country is to put forward a bold progressive agenda. 
Life is not just fancy fundraisers. I urge my Republican colleagues: Listen to the health care stories of people like Georganne Koehler. 
Republicans have constituents who depend on Medicaid to survive. To throw those people off of their health care is shameful.
28 million Americans still don't have health care. What's Republicans' answer? Throw 22 million more Americans off health insurance.
"Republicans’ health care bill would cause devastating harm to millions of people. We will not allow that to happen.
"
Bernie is live now talking about why we must continue to fight the Republican health care bill.  
Republicans’ “health care” plan is nothing more than a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very rich. 
@SenSanders will be on the @Thom_Hartmann Program today.  Make sure you are tuned into FSTV  
Big show today w/ @sensanders on GOP plan to take our healthcare! Listen 3ET at  or on @progvoice channel
"Should we kick 235,900 Nevadans off of Medicaid so that Sheldon Adelson can get a $48 million dollar tax break every year? "
Yes. We need to improve Obamacare. But the way to do that is not to throw 22 million people off of insurance.
Net neutrality means that everyone has the same access to the same information — that the internet remains free from corporate control.
"The telecom industry and their friends, like @AjitPaiFCC, want to allow corporations like Comcast, AT&amp;T &amp; Verizon to control content online."
@AjitPaiFCC It's time to fight @AjitPaiFCC's attempt to auction off the internet to the highest corporate bidder. Comment here: 
"When Obama saved Net Neutrality, I had to dance. Now Trump’s FCC wants to destroy it? No way. #KeepKeithDancing "
"At this moment when our democratic institutions are in peril, ending #netneutrality protections would be devastating. "

"A massive tax break for the wealthy paid for by throwing children, the sick, and the vulnerable off insurance? That’s morally obscene. "
"The revised Republican ""health care"" plan is an absolute disaster that will inflict severe economic pain on millions of Americans."
The Republican bill is fatally flawed and no small tweak here or there will undo the massive damage that it to the country.
"Make no mistake about it, thousands of Americans every year will die unnecessarily if the Republican legislation is passed."
"My Republican colleagues just love to talk about choice, but somehow they want to tell every woman in the U.S.what to do with their bodies. "
"After getting diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer, the Medicaid expansion in West Virginia saved Rusty Williams' life. "
"The latest Republican ""health care"" bill is out. Big surprise: it's still a disaster.
"
I hope Trump supporters in rural states understand that what he said during the campaign about standing up for working people was a lie. 
"In my view, we need to guarantee health care to everyone a right, not throw millions of Americans off of health insurance."
He's here! @SenSanders #FeelTheBern! 
"Remember: the change we are fighting for is not radical. On issue after issue, the majority of the American people are on our side."
Older Americans should be able to remain in their homes and communities. They deserve to live with dignity and with a sense of security. 
"As Fox News' Chris Wallace says, getting to the bottom of Trump's campaign ties to Russia should not be a Democrat versus Republican issue. "
I'm delighted to see the disastrous Republican health care plan won't succeed – a victory for the millions who stood up and fought back.
"The American people want to proceed to health care for all, not see 22 million Americans thrown off the health care they currently have."
Health care is a human right.

 "
".@algore: “So long as big money has an influence… they can force states legislatures to hold back renewables.""
 "
"Thanks to @algore for not only calling attention to the crisis of climate change, but also for rallying people around the solutions."
There is a very important issue that almost no one talks about and that is the issue of youth unemployment. 
It is beyond my comprehension that we have a president who wants millions of people to suffer just so he can score some political points. 
"We all know that politics is ugly, but Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer is most certainly not politics as usual. "
.@algore continues to educate people around the world on the planetary crisis of climate change. We thank him so much for that. 
The parliamentarian’s decision today proves once again that the process Republicans have undertaken to repeal the ACA is a disaster.

It's time to stop worrying about Trump's absurd tweets and start worrying about the dangerous legislation he and Republicans are pushing.
Religious leaders have a message for Republicans who are still trying to take health care away from millions of people. 
"I hope Republicans understand the consequences of their vote today. When you take 22 million off health insurance, many thousand could die."
I really don't want to be on the phone telling any parent that their child might die because of legislation that Republicans might pass. 
This is a disgrace. It is insulting. And it is undemocratic. 
'No Cuts to Medicaid!' Disability advocates from ADAPT are sitting in now at the Hart Senate building 
"This is America, we are not going to pass legislation that allows thousands of people to die. "

"Reconciliation's function is to adjust spending and revenue, not enact major social policy changes. Republicans are abusing this process."
"Mr. Trump, you are on the wrong side of history. Discrimination has no place in our military or society. We must stand with trans people. "
Today I joined @RonWyden on the Senate floor to expose some of the most destructive aspects of the disastrous Republican health care bill. 
A vote for ‘skinny repeal’ is a vote to take health insurance from 16 million and drastically increase premiums for everyone else.
Speaking now on the Senate floor about Sen. Daines’ sham single-payer amendment. 
".@SenSanders is correct: Health care is a right, not a privilege. We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone has access to it."
"In America, if you are rich or if you are poor, yes, you are entitled to health care as a human right and not a privilege."
Today I finally got the chance to quote President Trump on the Senate floor on how Australia's health care system is better than ours. 
"I am strongly supportive of sanctions on Russia and North Korea. However, I worry very much about President Trump’s approach to Iran."

"CBO on ""skinny"" bill:

Thank you to everyone across the country who stood up and fought back. Tonight was a victory for the American people.
This is only the first step. We must now move forward to guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege.
"Thank you to the folks in the disability communities, the folks in Planned Parenthood, and the millions more who stood up and fought back. "
People do not deserve to die because they cannot afford health care. I cannot make it any clearer than that. Health care is a human right. 
Here's @SenSanders conversation with @SecDef19 William Perry on how to resolve the nuke crisis with N Korea: 
I do hope that one day soon Republicans finally catch on so we can join the industrialized world and guarantee health care as a right. 
Bernie Sanders responds to Trump's threats: Every American should get the health care congresspeople have #CNNSOTU 
The president should stop tweeting for awhile and realize that America is the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people.

It's never easy to stand together and try to form a union. I applaud the Nissan workers in Mississippi fighting for workers' rights. 
Nissan is an all-too-familiar story of how greedy corporations divide and conquer working people. 
Why doesn't a profit-driven health care system work? This Canadian businessman explains why.

"Filmmakers, entertainers and even some billionaires understand that a single-payer system is the most effective way to bring down costs. "
Trickle-down economics is a fraud and we will not accept it. It is and it has always been an abysmal failure and a fraud. 
"This is a rigged economy, designed by the wealthiest people in this country to benefit themselves at the expense of everybody else."
We desperately need to address the massive inequality that exists in America today.
The days of allowing drug makers to gouge American consumers after taking taxpayer money must end. 
Trump’s bombastic rhetoric is not appropriate when we are dealing with the possibility of a nuclear war that could kill millions of people. 
We need serious people at the @StateDept dealing with the issue of North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons &amp; missile capability.
@StateDept Our job is to work with China and our allies in the region &amp; around the world on a comprehensive diplomatic strategy to address the problem.
I spoke with @SenSanders a few weeks ago on how we can avoid military conflict with North Korea 
The white nationalist demonstration in #Charlottesville is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred that has no place in our society.
"While this incident is alarming, it is not surprising. Hate crimes and shows of hostility toward minorities have recently been surging."
Now more than ever we must stand together against those who threaten our brothers and sisters.
"No, Mr. President. This is a provocative effort by Neo-Nazis to foment racism and hatred and create violence. Call it out for what it is. "
"In America, should working class people have shorter lives because they can't afford the health care they need? "

We must vigorously #DefendDACA and the young people in that program. We cannot be sweeping up millions and throwing them out of the country.

".@realDonaldTrump, you are embarrassing our country and the millions of Americans who fought and died to defeat Nazism."
"@realDonaldTrump The violence in Charlottesville was not caused by the ""alt-left,"" (whatever that may be). It was caused by Neo-Nazis and white supremacists."
The violence in Charlottesville was caused by Neo-Nazis and white supremacists attempting to spread their hateful and racist ideology. 
"It's incredibly painful to see neo-Nazis marching in the US, but even more painful that our president hasn’t forthrightly condemned them."

"Trump said he was going to ""drain the swamp."" Appointing Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary was the opposite of draining the swamp. "
"In my view, we should not be celebrating individuals who took up arms against the U.S. and defended the horrific institution of slavery."
It's important for every community in America—including those of us in Congress—to take a hard look at the historical figures we honor.

"We should be increasing voter participation, not making it harder to vote."
The real crisis we face is not voter fraud. It is voter suppression. 
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage. 
"By pardoning Sheriff Arpaio, Trump has again made clear he will use the powers of the presidency to defend racism and discrimination."
The thousands of people terrorized and brutalized by Arpaio's illegal actions deserve justice. No one in America should live in fear.
Our thoughts are with people in Houston and throughout Texas who are struggling with the devastating flooding brought by Hurricane Harvey.
"This disaster reminds us that we are all Americans, and that when any community is in trouble all of our resources should be used to help."
"Today it is Texas, next month it might be Vermont, next year it might be Michigan. We are strongest when we stand together."
Francisco and the thousands of other victims who were subjected to Arpaio's brutality deserve justice. 
Thank you to all the courageous individuals who have risked their lives to save others.

Our job today: make sure lives are saved in Houston. Our job tomorrow: understand the role that climate change has played in this tragedy.
"President Trump, you don’t fix a rigged economy by giving huge tax breaks to the billionaires and corporations that rigged it."

The reason I'm supporting Medicare for All is really quite simple: it’s the right thing to do.

#MedicareForAll means middle class families will never have to spend 20 or 30 percent of their incomes on health care.
@SenSanders Because no one should avoid getting medical care out of fear that they won't be able to afford it!
It is high time we take a look at what countries around the world do to provide quality care to all people. - @SenSanders  #MedicareForAll

Join me and Dr. Danielle Martin at 11:30 AM ET to discuss the fight for #MedicareForAll.  Watch here:  
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
.@SenSanders is with us now to discuss his #singlepayer bill. 
"Pharma CEOs are nervous, and they should be. "
Starting soon: Join me and Dr. Danielle Martin for a Facebook Live conversation about the Canadian single-payer system and Medicare for all. 
LIVE NOW: Talking with Dr. Danielle Martin about the Canadian single-payer system and Medicare for all: 
I'm live now w/ @SenSanders talking about the realities of #singlepayer #healthcare in #Canada &amp; the biggest myths.  
Is the Canadian single-payer system popular? Dr. Martin says 94% of Canadians like it:  
Why does the United States pay twice as much per capita on health care than any other nation on Earth?  
"“If your #MedicareForAll plan passes in the U.S., you will have a better system than Canada does.” –@docdanielle
 "
"One myth in the U.S. about Canadian #healthcare: if it gets paid for by the gov't, it must somehow be inferior. Not so. "
"Another myth in the U.S. about #Canadian #healthcare: Canadians wait for urgent care. Not so, if it's an emerg you get in. #MedicareForAll "
.@RandPaul seems to think a right to health care is akin to slavery. This Canadian doctor thinks otherwise. 
"No Mr. President, providing health care to every man, woman and child as a right is not a curse, it's exactly what we should be doing. "
What is a curse is your support for throwing 23 million off health insurance. That's the curse and we won't allow you to get away with it.
Here's why this Canadian doctor supports @BernieSanders' plan for universal health care 
This racist act must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. No one should live in fear in their own community. 
"Medicare is enormously successful, cost-effective and popular. Now is the time to expand and improve it to cover all Americans."
Insurance and drug companies and Wall Street will devote a lot of money to defeat #MedicareForAll. But they're on the wrong side of history.
Our immediate concern is to beat back yet another disastrous Republican proposal to throw millions of people off health insurance.
#MedicareForAll means middle class families would save thousands of dollars. It’s financially smart and the moral thing to do.

Republicans have until Oct. 1 to pass their new Obamacare repeal. We cannot let them destroy our health care. We need to fight back.
A small group of Republicans cannot be allowed to destroy our health care system while keeping the American people in the dark. 
"Republicans are once again trying to throw millions of Americans off insurance, make huge cuts to Medicaid and defund Planned Parenthood. "
"Procedure Point: if Graham/Cassidy comes to the floor, it would get 2 minutes of debate equally divided. That's it! 1/6 of the economy/2min."
"Now is the time to educate, organize and fight back. We won't allow Republicans to destroy our health care. "
"Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill IS Trumpcare, &amp; it will rip health care away from millions of Americans."
It would be beyond comprehension for Republicans to proceed with their health care bill without knowing its impact on the American people. 
"The latest threat to Obamacare is very real.

"
Don’t sleep on the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill. It will defund Planned Parenthood &amp; cost millions coverage. We need everyone shouting.
"I honestly cannot explain why any Senator would vote for Graham-Cassidy, such a cruel bill. But Republicans almost have the votes."
Our job over the next five to ten days is to get the word out about this horrific legislation and do everything we can to defeat it.

"Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill."

LIVE NOW: Sen. Sanders delivers the 58th Green Foundation Lecture on foreign policy at Westminster College:  
We need to begin a more vigorous debate about foreign policy. But we also need a broader understanding of what foreign policy is. #BernieFP
"Foreign policy is about 7,000 Americans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan and hundreds of thousands of those countries’ people dying. #BernieFP"
Foreign policy is about having a defense budget of ~$700 billion when we spend more on defense than the next 12 nations combined. #BernieFP
What Eisenhower said over 50 years ago is even more true today. #BernieFP 
"If we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad, we need to practice those values here at home. #BernieFP"
"When people in America march as neo-Nazis or white supremacists, we can have no ambiguity in condemning everything they stand for. #BernieFP"
"Six people own more wealth than half of the world’s population. There is no justification for that. #BernieFP
"
"Sensible foreign policy understands that climate change is a real threat, not a hoax, and that no country can combat it alone. #BernieFP"
"When we talk about foreign policy, at the very top of our list of concerns is the need to revitalize American democracy. #BernieFP"
"When the president spoke at the UN, he did not mention that Russia tried to undermine our democracy. Well, I will:
"
I say to Mr. Putin: we will not allow you to undermine American democracy or democracies around the world. #BernieFP
Dialogue cannot only take place between ministers and diplomats at the UN. It should be taking place at the grassroots level. #BernieFP
It's reasonably easy to overthrow a government. It's far harder to know the long-term impact that that action will have. #BernieFP
Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement was incredibly foolish and short-sighted. And it will also hurt our economy. #BernieFP
"When we see demonstrations of white supremacy, we must be unequivocal in our condemnation, as our president shamefully was not. #BernieFP"
We cannot speak with the moral authority the world needs if we do not struggle to achieve the ideal we are holding out for others. #BernieFP
"The war on terror has caused us to undermine our own moral standards regarding torture, indefinite detention and the use of force. #BernieFP"
We must rethink the old Washington mindset that judges “seriousness” according to the willingness to use force.  #BernieFP

Americans won a major victory. We've stopped another disastrous Republican bill. Now we must go forward and guarantee health care to all. 
We must act immediately to end this humanitarian crisis. 
I would like to thank every single American who came out to fight back and save our health care. You are why we won. 
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, Trump's tax plan is morally repugnant and bad economic policy."
It is particularly obscene for Trump to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $269 billion tax break to the top 0.2%.

Watch this Canadian doctor discuss the difference between practicing medicine in Canada versus the United States. 
The last thing we should do right now is provide 100s of billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations.
Let’s be clear: 99.8% of Americans would not receive a nickel if Trump repeals the estate tax. But millionaires and billionaires would.
You don’t fix a rigged economy by giving huge tax breaks to the billionaires and corporations that rigged it.
Cutting taxes on huge corporations doesn’t create jobs. It makes CEOs richer and puts a bigger burden on the middle class. 
"Who benefits from Trump's plan to repeal the estate tax? Only the top 0.2% — Trump, his cabinet, and other millionaires and billionaires. "
Why does Norway rank so much higher than the U.S. on health outcomes? These Norwegian doctors explain:

Puerto Ricans are suffering. They are American citizens entitled to the same help as everyone else. We've got to do all we can to help.
Let's remember why NFL players started kneeling. They are talking about the need for criminal justice reform and police department reform.
My thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and all those wounded in the horrific shooting in Las Vegas.
"I also want to thank the first responders who did an outstanding job responding to this tragedy, saving many lives."
Last night’s attack is the deadliest mass shooting in our country's modern history. This year there have been more mass shootings than days.
It should be clear that we have got to do everything we can to stop guns from falling into the hands of people who should not have them.
It is long past time for Congress to take action on gun safety to save innocent lives.
Jane and I are deeply saddened to hear that Vermonter Sandy Casey was among the victims in Vegas. Our hearts are with her friends &amp; family.

"It’s too late for the victims in Las Vegas, but it's not too late to prevent more innocent Americans from becoming victims of gun violence."
There is no reason for any civilian to own an automatic weapon.
Common sense suggests that we have got to do everything possible to prevent the conversion of semi-automatic rifles into automatic rifles. 
The Republican budget cuts Medicaid by over $1 trillion and Medicare by $473 billion over 10 years. Mr. Trump: promise to veto this budget. 
".@SenSanders: ""In almost every instance, this budget ignores the needs of ordinary Americans."" "
What happened in Las Vegas is a tragedy. But it's one we continue to repeat. We need commonsense legislation to save innocent people. 
“Bump stocks” provide an effective workaround to convert a legal weapon into an illegal one. We need to ban them and save lives. 
These millionaires want President Trump to know there is nothing patriotic about shifting the tax burden onto the middle class. 
Now is the time for President Trump to stop his insulting tweets. Now is the time to rebuild Puerto Rico. 
What are the benefits of a publicly funded health care system? This Canadian doctor explains:

"Senate Republicans continue to say they aren’t *really* cutting Medicare and Medicaid.

Yes, they are.

"The Republican budget contains cuts that will kill people, cuts that will hurt people, cuts that should not be allowed in a humane society."
"Republicans say, ""We don't want to hurt Medicare."" Then why does their budget cut it by $473 billion? "
This is nothing less than sexism. It's the latest display of Republicans’ total disdain for women’s ability to control their own lives. 
"Despite the Trump administration’s destructive efforts, we will not stop fighting for women’s rights and full reproductive justice."

"Donald Trump is in Pennsylvania to tell truck drivers how his tax plan will benefit them. Unfortunately, once again, the president is lying."
Trump's tax plan will provide virtually no benefit to truck drivers and result in a tax increase for millions of middle class Americans.
80% of the tax benefits in Trump’s plan will go to the top 1%. This gift to millionaires will result in huge cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.
Trump’s tax plan takes from the poor and working families in order to give to the very rich. This disastrous proposal must be defeated.
We are so excited to have @SenSanders join us at the #WomensConvention October 27-29th in Detroit!

President Trump’s refusal to certify the Iran deal is the latest in a series of reckless moves that make Americans less safe.
Trump's own top security officials say Iran is meeting its commitments under the deal and that it is in the security interests of the US.
"Now that this decision has been put in Congress’ hands, it’s up to us to stop this drift toward war."
Congress should listen to what virtually the entire national security community is saying – that the Iran deal is working – and protect it.

"Trump and Republican leaders claim their budget gives a ""big league"" tax cut for the middle class. Nothing could be further from the truth."
Republicans' budget cuts Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over 10 years – which would throw some 15 million Americans off health insurance.
Mr. Trump forgot to tell these truckers in Pennsylvania that only the top 0.2% of Americans would benefit by repealing the estate tax. 
Why are Republicans bringing forth such an absurd budget that is diametrically opposed to what the American people want? Follow the money.
Poll after poll after poll tells us the overwhelming majority of Americans don't want cuts Medicare or Medicaid.
"In this budget, Republicans want to cut Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by over $1 trillion in the next 10 years. Disgraceful."
I have something to say to Mr. Trump: Tell your Republican friends in the Senate you'll veto this disastrous budget.  
Who's pushing Republicans to pass tax cuts for the rich that only 12% of Americans support? Their billionaire donors.

"Trickle-down economics is a myth, plain and simple. Creating massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations doesn't create jobs. "
Let me make a prediction: @SenTedCruz is going to tell you that because of tax cuts for the wealthy you will all be rich. That's a lie.
"What the entire GOP proposal is about is giving tax breaks to people who don’t need it by making cuts to education, housing and health care."
".@SenTedCruz: This tax plan will create jobs
FACT: Tax cuts create few jobs. esp. when cutting infrastructure &amp; healthcare"
"The Koch brothers and billionaire donors want these tax cuts very badly. In fact, @SenTedCruz just met with them. "
Does it make more sense to give tax breaks to the top 1% or rebuild our infrastructure and create 15 million jobs? #CNNDebateNight
False. The effective tax rate for large profitable corporations is just 14%. Corporate taxes as a share of GDP are lower than 22 countries. 
"The Republican Party has been calling the estate tax a ""death tax"" for years. The truth is it affects only the top 0.2% "
"If @SenTedCruz doesn't come through for the Koch brothers on these tax cuts, he's going to be in trouble. "

So excited to have @SenSanders in #Toronto to talk about our #healthcare.Tune in @ 11amET for a live talk:  
LIVE: Sen. Sanders speaks at the University of Toronto on what the U.S. can learn from Canadian health care:  
How a country deals with health care for its citizens isn't just about about medicine or technology. It's about its core values as a nation.
Are you truly free if you work 100 hours a week because you can’t find a job with a living wage? Are you free if you have no health care?
“How free are you if you are one of the 28 mi Americans who can’t afford to go to the doctor if you are sick?” @SenSanders #medicareforall
Gov. Rosselló is right. We must immediately nullify Whitefish Energy’s outrageous $300 million contract.

I'm with @SenSanders. It's not a radical idea that the wealthy should pay a little more to help working New Yorkers get where they're going. 
"There is a lot going on, but we need to take a minute to talk about a health care crisis no one is talking about. "
Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health care because Congress did not renew funding for the community health center program.
"CHCs provide affordable, high-quality health care to more than 27 million people including primary care, dentistry and low-cost Rx drugs."
"Community health centers save lives, but they also save money. They’ve generated $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system."
"Unless we renew community health center funding, 70% of funds will be cut. 2,800 CHCs will close. And 9 million patients will lose care."
Thousands die each year because they can’t afford to get to a doctor. The situation must not get worse. We must fully fund the CHC program.
"Amazingly, Trump is waging war against a group that didn't exist when the authorization of military force passed. "
"A new authorization must be specific about who we are fighting, the mission objectives and reporting requirements from the president."
You know what's really scary? Millionaires and billionaires using their wealth and power to undermine our democracy. 
"About 70% of Puerto Rico still has no power, as many as 900 could be dead and thousands need food, shelter and clean water. We must help. "

"We won't be distracted from your efforts to give billionaires tax cuts, take health care from millions and deny climate change. Do your job. "
Trump has repeatedly reneged on his promises by supporting the wealthy at the expense of working families.

"The time is long, long past for us to put the lives of children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA’s corporate backers."
Our pattern of doing nothing after mass shootings must end. Gun violence in America is a major crisis which must be addressed.

Watch @docdanielle debunk one of Fox News' most pathetic single payer myths: 
Our fight against the Republican tax plan requires the same urgency as when they tried to repeal Obamacare. Health care for 13 million Americans is at stake. 
"Just like we defeated Republicans' efforts to repeal Obamacare, we need to stop their tax plan. Join me and @MoveOn tonight at 8 ET at  to get ready to fight back. "
"Two months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still living in misery. As a nation we must do better. "
We shouldn't throw 13 million people off of health insurance to give more money to billionaires and corporations. I can't believe we even have to say that. 
"Paul Ryan has been fantasizing about cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for years. Ryan's plan must be defeated. "
"If we are going to stop Republicans from taking health care from millions and slashing Medicare to give tax cuts to the wealthy and large corporations, NOW is the time to stand up and fight back. "

Ridiculous. The idea of “clean coal” is pure fiction. It's a concept intended to keep us tied to fossil fuels when we should be embracing sustainable sources of energy. 
Republicans' tax bill would throw 13 million Americans off of health insurance. Here's how: 
"Once again, the Trump administration sides with big money and against democracy. If this passes, the internet and its free exchange of information as we have come to know it will cease to exist.  #NetNeutrality "
"Trump's sanctuary cities policy is federal coercion to enforce the president’s racist, anti-immigrant policies. This is a check on an out-of-control executive branch and a victory for the rule of law. "
Why are big CEOs trying to convince the American people that trickle-down economics works? We already know that it doesn't. 
The Republican tax bill would be a major step forward in creating the kind of oligarchy long envisioned by the Koch brothers and other powerful right wing extremists.
"If the tax plan is passed, giving huge breaks to the 1% and raising the deficit $1.5 trillion, Republican leaders will rediscover ""the deficit crisis"" and move aggressively to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. This has been a tough year, but we can move forward in a direction based on generosity and love. "
The U.S. and other developed countries must develop policies to improve life for the desperately poor around the world. We should not be making a bad situation even worse. 
"Today and every day, our workers deserve $15 an hour, decent working conditions and the right to form a union. #BlackFriday"
"""Deficit hawks"" are keeping their criticism on the down-low. They will reappear screaming from the rooftops the minute the tax bill is signed, demanding cuts to Social Security &amp; Medicare. Bet on it. "
"Bernie Sanders hits the trail again, this time to fight GOP tax bill "
".@SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr, how much will you cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to pay for a $1.4 trillion deficit increase? How much will you cut Pell Grants, WIC and Head Start? The people have a right to know. "
We are here to tell the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands that they are not forgotten. They are not alone. @SenSanders 
It makes no sense to simply put things back the way they were in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We have to help the islands build back stronger.  
"The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are not forgotten, they are not alone, and we will do everything possible to rebuild those beautiful islands."
Joining @SenSanders to call for short term relief and long term recovery for #PuertoRico

How is it a tax reform plan for the middle class if 87 million middle class households will see their taxes go up?

Who in their right mind believes now is the time to give massive tax breaks to billionaires? #TaxDebate 
Let's get the facts straight: 62% of the benefits in the Senate Republican tax plan go to the top 1% and 40% of the benefits go to the top 0.1% by the end of the decade. #TaxDebate
"FACT: Under the Republican plan, a single mother making minimum wage with two kids would get only a $75 tax credit. Meanwhile, a family making $500k with two kids would get a $4,000 tax credit. #TaxDebate"
"The top 0.1% of Americans are already doing pretty well. But Republicans say they need even more. So they're giving them an average break of $208,000. Unbelievable. #TaxDebate"
"FACT: If state and local deductions are repealed, almost 30% of taxpayers, including individuals in very state and in all income brackets, would be adversely impacted. #TaxDebate"
Ted Cruz keeps saying we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. That is false. #TaxDebate 
Here's something I wish Tim Scott and Ted Cruz would understand: Corporate tax cuts don't create jobs. #TaxDebate 
I’m for a tax break for small businesses and for working families all over this country. What I am not for is enormous tax breaks for billionaires. #TaxDebate
"Republicans want to repeal the estate tax, which applies only to the top 0.2 percent. That's a disgrace. #TaxDebate "
Repealing the estate tax will give hundreds of billion of dollars to the wealthiest people in this country. #TaxDebate 
"37 of 38 experts agreed that the Republican tax bills would cause U.S. debt to increase ""substantially"" faster than the economy. The 38th said he misread the question. #TaxDebate

 "
"It is without doubt that as soon as this tax legislation is passed, Republicans will rediscover their religion about the deficit and say we need “entitlement reform.”"
What “entitlement reform” actually means is massive cuts to Social Security at a time when millions of older workers have nothing in the bank for their retirement.

"I know that Trump is not much into history or the U.S. Constitution, but he ought to know that millions of men and women have struggled, fought and died to defend our democracy and the religious freedom that our Constitution guarantees."
"I will be listening eagerly for any Republican to tell me they will not come back from increasing the deficit $1.4 trillion with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. "
"The bottom line: the American people do not want us to pass tax breaks for billionaires today and they certainly don’t want us to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

"When Reagan slashed taxes for the rich in 1981, economic growth went down by 1.9% the following year and the unemployment rate increased. The 1981 tax cut was so ""successful"" that Reagan had to increase taxes 11 times after that."

"If you think Republicans aren't going to wake up the day after they pass massive tax cuts and start saying that we need to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to shrink the deficit, watch @SpeakerRyan explain their plan. "
"Tonight I asked my Republican colleague Sen. Toomey to guarantee to the American people there would not be cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid after this tax bill. He couldn't do that. "
Today Senator Rubio tried to tell me he wouldn't cut Medicare or Social Security. That's not what he said yesterday morning. 
"We’ve seen this movie before. It was a bad movie. The last time Congress enacted a corporate tax holiday on overseas profits in 2004, the top 15 beneficiaries cut 21,000 U.S. jobs. "

"Maybe I missed it, but I don't remember the need to provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge fund managers in the Virgin Islands being one of our nation's pressing crises. Yet that's exactly what Section 14504 of the GOP bill does. "

What bill? We still haven't seen what we're voting on. 
"During the campaign, Trump promised to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Now Congressional Republicans are getting ready to cut them. "
A vote for the Republican tax bill is a vote to take health insurance away from millions of Americans.

"Republican plan:
1. Run up the deficit with tax breaks for the wealthy
2. Freak out about the deficit
3. Cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to bring down the deficit"
Corporate America doesn't want to reduce their tax rate down to 20 percent. They want it down to zero. And that's a burden that will fall on the backs of the middle class. 
"As a member of the tax conference committee, I will do everything I can to defeat this bill. We need to rebuild the disappearing middle class, not provide more tax breaks to billionaires."
A disaster. A joke. A lie. Here's how these millionaires describe the fraudulent trickle-down economic theory: 
Buried in the Republican tax plan are hidden provisions designed to stick it to the poor and working class while the rich and corporations get billions of dollars in breaks. 
"The Republicans, who control the Senate, House and White House, must not be allowed to shut down the government. They must work in a bipartisan way to pass a budget which reflects the needs of all Americans, not just wealthy campaign contributors."
"Republicans cannot ask for $54 billion more in military spending, and ignore the health care needs of our children and working families in the CHIP and Community Health Center programs."
"Republicans cannot ignore the reality that 800,000 Dreamers will start losing their legal status in a few months."
"Republicans cannot ignore millions of older workers who are about to lose the pensions they were promised, younger people burdened with outrageous levels of student debt or veterans unable to get the quality health care they were promised."
"Mr. Trump, watch these Patriotic Millionaires explain how to stimulate the economy. It's not by giving massive tax breaks to your billionaire friends. "

"Sen. Sanders says he will vote against the continuing resolution because ""Republicans have been so busy trying to give huge tax breaks to billionaires"" that they ""haven't paid one iota of attention"" to DACA or the CHIP program  "
"Republicans are celebrating raising taxes on working families to give tax breaks to billionaires, corporations, private jet owners and themselves. Remember that. "
"An inspiring read from my colleagues in the upper chamber, @SenSanders &amp; @SenWarren. I agree - it’s time we look beyond providing our citizens with the bare minimum, and be bold in our vision. "
"It would be unconscionable to leave Washington after giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, while we ignore the enormous problems facing working families.  "
Workers in America have earned their retirement benefits from a lifetime of hard work. We cannot allow Paul Ryan to destroy these programs. 
"I received hundreds of questions from Snapchatters all over the country, from how this Republican tax bill will impact your life to my favorite flavor of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Got to the Discover tab on Snapchat and add me as a friend (bernie.sanders) to watch. "
"Doesn’t it tell us a lot about Republican priorities when the tax breaks for corporations are permanent, while the tax breaks for working families expire at the end of 8 years?"
Congress needs to get its act together and pass funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Health care for 9 million children is at stake. 9 million children.
"I am a big ""no"" vote on the continuing resolution because it is unconscionable for Congress to go on break when there are so many enormous problems facing the country that need our attention right now. "
"Sen. Bernie Sanders on DACA: “If we do not act, you’re going to have 800,000 people with no legal status who will be subject to deportation. Thrown out of the only country they have ever known. This is a moral outrage.” #CNNSOTU "
At least Trump is finally telling the truth about his tax bill. 
"What we could do with $1.5 trillion:
-Make college tuition-free
-Provide universal preschool
-Repair our crumbling infrastructure
-Fund CHIP for 107 years
-Rebuild Puerto Rico

What Republicans did:
-Give tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations
"
"My thoughts are with Erica Garner, her family and friends in hoping that she has a full recovery and rejoins the struggle for justice as soon as possible. I have had the privilege of joining with her at a number of events and was deeply impressed with her courage and insights."
The Republicans are so desperate to spin their disastrous tax plan that they have resorted to taking comments I recently made completely out of context. Let me set the record straight. 
"The United States is virtually the only country on earth that allows pharmaceutical companies to jack up the price of a life-saving cancer drug by 1,400%. This is an outrage. "
"It is astounding that we have a president who celebrates 13 million people losing their health insurance. Instead of bragging about more Americans without health care, we should be joining the rest of the industrialized world and guaranteeing health care to all people as a right. "
"If Congress does not get its act together, we're going to have 800,000 bright young people with no legal status who will be subject to deportation and thrown out of the only country they have ever known. We must protect the DREAMers and move them towards citizenship. "
It is the right of all people to speak out against their government. The government of Iran should respect this right and heed the voices of thousands of Iranians who are demonstrating across the country for better opportunities and a better future.
"Here is a New Year's Resolution I hope you will share with me. In 2018, we will not only intensify the struggle against Trumpism, we will increase our efforts to spread the progressive vision in every corner of the land."
"Watch Canadian doctor @docdanielle respond to the pathetic myth that single-payer health care is a ""Big Brother-style"" government takeover: "
Don't be fooled by Trump when he talks about boosts to the stock market from his tax plan. That money is going to the wealthy and large corporations. 
This is a simple matter of priorities. With $1.5 trillion we could eliminate child poverty in America two times over. What did Trump and Republicans in Congress choose to do? Give permanent tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations. 
"During his campaign, Trump said over and over again that he would stick it to the wealthy by closing the egregious carried interest loophole. Guess what? His disgraceful tax bill did nothing to address it and even Fox Business commentators are fed up with his broken promises. "
"Iceland just became the first country in the world to make it illegal to pay men more than women. In the United States in 2016, black women made 62.5 cents on the dollar compared to white men and hispanic women made 54.4 cents. That is a disgrace. "
"No, Attorney General Sessions. Marijuana is not the same as heroin. No one who has seriously studied the issue believes that. Quite the contrary. We should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse the progress that has been made."
"I will be speaking on the Senate floor at 12:30 PM about the budget negotiations. I'm very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, Senate and House, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown."
Watch live here: 
"I am very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, the House and the Senate, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown. They must not allow that. They have got to compromise."
"When Republicans want to add some $100 billion to military spending over the next two years we will not turn our backs on working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must have parity between defense and non-defense spending."
The U.S. Congress has got to do more than increase military spending and give tax breaks to billionaires. We are here to protect working families.
Leader McConnell’s statement is very disturbing and misleading. He conveniently ignores the fact that mandatory spending on domestic programs have been severely cut and that the Defense Department has received tens of billions in OCO funding that isn't capped at all. 
"Mr. Trump, listen to these Patriotic Millionaires who want their taxes raised, not cut. "
"More than repair and rebuilding, Puerto Rico and USVI need full recovery with vision for the future – a Marshall Plan like what I’ve introduced w/ @SenSanders and others. "
"When history looks back on this period, I do not want people to see a U.S. Congress which worked overtime to protect billionaires and large corporations but turned its back on providing health care to vulnerable children. "
"This is a health crisis that no one is talking about it. If Congress does not act soon to fund the Community Health Center program, 2,800 health centers will close their doors. "
"I'm not sure why President Trump wants to shut down the government over an $18 billion wall that no one wants, isn't needed and Mexico won't pay for. What the American people want, overwhelmingly, is to provide legal protection and a path toward citizenship for 800,000 Dreamers."
"Instead of Attorney General Sessions intensifying the failed war on drugs, states should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. "
"President Trump insists there will be no DACA deal without border wall funding. @SenTomCotton and @SenSanders take on the looming Senate debate over immigration, this morning on ""This Week."" "
It's not just Democrats and Independents. More Republicans support allowing Dreamers to stay in the country than support building a wall. It couldn't be clearer what Congress needs to do.
The American people do not want to spend billions of dollars on a wall which Trump told us would be paid for by Mexico. They want to protect Dreamers and working families. 
"The Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, they control the House. They will determine whether or not there is a government shutdown. I certainly hope there is not a government shutdown."
We need to get our priorities right. Not giving tax breaks to billionaires. Not throwing millions of people off of health insurance. We have got to pay attention to the working families of the this country.
"Because the president revoked DACA, some 800,000 young people are living in extraordinary anxiety about whether or not they're going to lose legal status and be subject to deportation. We have got to deal with that decision."
"Today marks 100 days since Congress let the Children’s Health Insurance Program expire.

Let me say that again: health care for 9 million children has hung in the balance for 100 days.

We must do better than this."
I don't know why President Trump and Republicans want to shut down the government over a wall no one wants and an unprecedented $100 billion increase in military spending. What the American people want is to protect Dreamers and working families. 
"The American people are increasingly disgusted with a government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the powerful. We must pass a budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and not just billionaire campaign contributors.
"
Does single-payer health care mean “government-run” health care? Canadian @docdanielle breaks it down: 
"While Trump and his billionaire friends play golf in Florida, low-income Americans and people with disabilities across this country are struggling to stay warm. "
Maybe Trump and Republican leaders believe a government shutdown would be a welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation. But a shutdown would harm working-class families who would be unable to access vital services.
"Kate and her family would not have been able to grow their organic farm without the help of the Children's Health Insurance Program. If Congress does not get its act together, 9 million children in working families will lose their health insurance. "
"Last night, President Trump received a standing ovation from a group of farmers after he told them they would no longer have to pay the estate tax. He forgot to mention that less than 0.1 percent of estate taxes are paid by small farmers. "
"We don't need to spend $18 billion on a wall which, by the way, Trump said would be paid for by the Mexican government. "
"This is one of the great moral issues of our time. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the DREAM Act now.
 "
"We must not hold the lives of 800,000 young Dreamers hostage in order to fund a wall that the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose. Sadly, it appears that is exactly what Donald Trump wants. "
What kind of a country are we if we deny health care to millions of children? 
The construction of a wall to keep unwelcome visitors out makes a lot of sense — if you were living under the Ming Dynasty in China in the 15th century when the Great Wall of China was expanded. 
The fight for net neutrality is not over. We can overturn the FCC's disastrous decision but we need your help. 
On January 23 we're going to try to do something that's never been done before. I hope you'll join us. 
We'll be sure to join @SenSanders on January 23 for an important #MedicareForAll townhall. 
"Sen. Sanders will host Medicare for All town hall Jan. 23, aiming for online audience bigger than cable. "
Do you live in a country with universal health care? What does that mean for you and your family? #MedicareForAll
@SenSanders I live in Sweden where every citizen has the privilege of universal health care. It gives my children and me a very important security that we can visit a doctor whenever necessary.
"@SenSanders I live in Germany. I don't have a family or serious health problems, but it's wonderful that I have no copay when I visit the doctor (GP and psychiatrist) and my prescription meds cost me less than €15 a quarter. Can't imagine returning to the US system"
"@SenSanders I live in Canada, and universal health care saved my son's life. He has a congenital heart defect that required major surgery...in your country it would have cost 10's of thousands of dollars we don't have...all covered here...he's now 21 and in college"
@SenSanders It means I live. I have a chronic disease and have needed treatment and surgery. Canada's universal health care  means I am alive today. I cannot imagine the strain and suffering without it.
"@SenSanders I was raised in the US &amp; Denmark. If it wasn’t for Denmark’s universal health care some of my family would be dead. My aunt was covered completely when she had breast cancer. My friends get paid leave when they have babies, both moms &amp; dads!  1/2"
@SenSanders I live in Canada. I had brain surgery to remove a tumour in 2016. I was in and out of the hospital in 2 days with a bill of $0.00 to pay.
"@SenSanders My sister had growth on her ovaries when she was 16, and had to remove one of it. We treated her in one of the hospital close to our house. Didnt cost us anything. She's graduating soon. -Malaysian."
"@SenSanders I live in Canada and our system isn’t perfect but when I got sick last year and ended up in the hospital for 4 days, it didn’t bankrupt my family, I didn’t receive a bill at all. I had a CT scan, x-ray, ultrasound, blood work."
"@SenSanders Argentine here. My father has bone cancer and the treatment would be absolutely unaffordable for us, but our health care system covers it up to 90%. Basically he's alive thanks to universal health care."
"@SenSanders I live in Australia - universal health care (Medicare) means we can get a medical diagnosis &amp; treatment for whatever medical problem arises as and when it does at no charge , including subsidised pharmaceuticals - that’s #equality"
"@SenSanders I live in Germany. I had breast cancer at the age of 35. I got the best possible care at nearly no cost, and it saved my live. My daughter and I even got to see a shrink for free to help us through it. Today, I am healthy, and I continue to raise my daughter, work, and pay taxes."

"Remember when CEOs said they'd create thousands of jobs if we gave them massive tax cuts? Well, AT&amp;T, Comcast and Pfizer just laid off hundreds of workers right after the Republicans passed their pathetic tax bill. "
Please take a moment to read the replies here. Every other major country has made health care a right. The U.S. is the anomaly. Remember that. 
"@SenSanders We're Canadian. Our son fell ill with a rare disease at 2. It took several days in hospital to diagnose &amp; treat.

Total cost to our family: Parking and a bit of hospital food (for me.) That's it.

Not worrying about medical bills allowed us to focus 100% on our son's health."

"Astoundingly, we have climate change policies being written by the world's biggest polluters. As @KateAronoff says, it is not enough to ask whether or not people believe in global warming, but what they can do to save this planet for future generations. "
There's one word for this kind of behavior: shameful. 
"Just found this excellent Bernie Sanders podcast on the #ParadisePapers. He talks about donors like Robert Mercer and the Koch brothers - 'They can't pay taxes but they do have a lot of money so spend on politics'
"
"Join Chris Cuomo and Sen. Bernie Sanders tonight on #CuomoPrimeTime, 9p ET "
Let’s be absolutely clear about what Republicans are doing by adding work requirements to Medicaid: they are attacking the poor. 
"My dad came from what I guess Trump would call a ""shithole"" country. He was able to come to the U.S. and became a very proud American. "
"All over this country are decent people who tell their kids, don’t judge people based on the color of their skin or the country they came from. Judge them on whether or not they are good human beings.

We have a president telling the world that's not what he does."
It’s not enough to just respond with anger. We have to build a political movement in this country which says that that is not who we are and we will not tolerate that type of moral inadequacy.
"Republicans in Congress must now summon the courage to stand up to the racist ramblings of our ""stable genius"" president."
Democratic and Republican senators must continue efforts to produce a bi-partisan Dream Act that can be voted upon by the Senate as part of the overall budget deal.
"I've got news for those who thought Mexico was going to pay for Trump's pointless wall. It ain't Mexico who's gonna pay, it's you, the American taxpayer. "
What does it feel like to be threatened with deportation? 
The inaugural opinion piece of the new Guardian is by @SenSanders 
"Taking on the greed of Wall Street, the power of gigantic multinational corporations and the influence of the global billionaire class is not only the moral thing to do – it is a strategic geopolitical imperative.
"
"Republicans want to increase defense spending by more than $150 billion over the next 2 years.

Meanwhile, this same Republican Party hasn't reauthorized spending for the Children's Health Insurance Program or Community Health Centers."
"To truly honor Dr. King we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for racial and economic justice in America and transform our national priorities. The struggle continues to this day, and our work is far from over. #MLKDay"
"As Congress moves forward this week on the budget, we must stand with Dreamers. Taking away the legal status of 800,000 young people who were raised in this country and subjecting them to the possibility of deportation would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history."
"We need one more Republican senator who has the decency to stand up to the telecom and cable industries and protect the American people. Let's find them.
"
I will vote no on reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill as written gives the government far too much power to spy on innocent U.S. citizens.
"We can and must protect our country from the serious potential of another terrorist attack without living in an Orwellian world where the government and private corporations can make warrantless searches of Americans' calls, emails and texts."
.@SenSanders and NowThis​ are hosting the first-ever national Medicare for All town hall on January 23. What would you like to ask him? 
Here's something you won't hear on Fox News: President Trump just presided over the worst overall year of job creation since 2010. 
"You would think that Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security might have met with a single Dreamer before planning to throw 800,000 of them out of the country. "
One. More. Vote. With the support of just one more Republican Senator we can pass my CRA to restore #NetNeutrality. Help us win this. We need your Senators to stand up for a free and open Internet. 
Even this Republican wants the government to stop spying on Americans. 
"Trump wants a shutdown. These are the major issues that have to be dealt with to stop him from getting his way.
 "
WATCH: Full interview with @SenSanders on #AMR @MSNBC 
"Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. They have to pass an annual budget, not more one-month continuing resolutions. We need a bipartisan solution to the economic crises facing the middle class, to the DACA crisis that Trump created and to disaster relief."
We must stand with Dreamers to stop Donald Trump from throwing them out of the only country they have ever known. 
We must pass disaster relief right now which treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands just as we will treat Texas and Florida. We cannot continue to delay given the enormous suffering there. 
"Mr. President, maybe the reason why more Americans emigrated to Norway last year than the other way around is because they have universal health care and a strong social democracy. "
"Billionaires got their tax breaks last month, but for 113 days health insurance for 9 million children has been hanging in the balance. "
There is a health care crisis about to go down that virtually no one is talking about. 
"Today at 11am ET: Press conference with @SenSanders, @SenWarren, @SenBobCasey followed by delivery of 250,000+ petitions demanding that Congressional Republicans fully fund the Social Security Administration:  #FundSSA "

"Republicans have got to fix the DACA crisis Trump precipitated. We are not going to allow 800,000 young Dreamers to be deported."
"When Republicans control the Senate, House and White House, and they blame Democrats for the shutdown, I don't think anybody is going to take that seriously."
We must stop a government shutdown.  
"It does not take great moral courage to pass an issue that nearly 9 in 10 Americans agree on – to allow DACA recipients to stay in the only country they have ever known and have a pathway to citizenship. And yet Republicans will not allow that to happen.
"
"@SenSanders ""Whatever the motives of the Republican leadership, one thing is clear: A government shutdown would be disastrous for the American people,"" @SenSanders wrote earlier this month. "
"Republicans, listen to what the Pentagon told us: We cannot continue this uncertainty. How the hell do you run a military on a month-to-month basis. You can't do it. Republicans, do your job. Run the damn government. "
"Today I urge, in the strongest possible terms, that the Republican leadership in the Senate accept its responsibility and not allow the government to shut down.  "
This morning I say to Senator McConnell: Please do not shut the government down. Sit down with the Democrats and start negotiating a compromise agreement.
You cannot run a government on a month-to-month basis. We cannot continue to abdicate our responsibility. We must address the problems facing the American people.

Has it really only been one year of Trump? It feels like 16 years. 
Trump and the Republicans are using health insurance for 9 million children as a bargaining chip for a wall that will do more harm than good. 
"Lauren is one of the 800,000 young people who grew up in our country and is now living in fear of being deported. "
We need a clean DREAM Act now 
How come Republicans can't negotiate an agreement on what 87 percent of Americans agree on? 
"Sen. Bernie Sanders says he's a 'no' vote on the continuing resolution: ""Mitch McConnell does not have the 60 votes and if he goes forward tonight at 10 o'clock ... he will lose"" "
I'm very disappointed that the Republicans chose to shut down the government. Leader McConnell insisted on going forward with a doomed vote rather than negotiating a serious agreement with the Democrats and Republicans who opposed him.
"I hope, based on last night's vote, that McConnell now changes his mind and begins to negotiate seriously. We must reopen the government as soon as possible."
"Bernie, saying it plain: ""Let’s wrench power back from the billionaires | Bernie Sanders"" "
Republicans can't negotiate an agreement on what 87 percent of Americans agree on. That is where we are right now. 
"For the first time in history, a one-party government was unable to keep the government going. That is pathetic. "
We are saying to Mitch McConnell and President Trump: You are going to have to start dealing with the real issues facing this country. 
Here's why Democrats are standing up to Trump and Mitch McConnell: 
Mitch McConnell is many things but he’s not dumb. He knows how to count. Bringing up a vote he knew was doomed an hour before the government shut down was absolutely irresponsible. This falls on his shoulders.
"When it comes to providing tax breaks to billionaires, Republicans will rush to get it done.

When it comes to passing a budget that protects the needs of working families—well, we are still waiting."
This Sunday @SenSanders joins @jaketapper for a live interview on #CNNSOTU. Tune in! 
We asked Republicans to pass a budget that would protect the needs of working families. They preferred to shut down the government instead.
"Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. The most fundamental responsibility of the governing party is to govern. I say to Republicans: Do your job."
Sen. Bernie Sanders addresses the Trump campaign’s new ad saying Democrats are complicit for murders committed by undocumented immigrants: “It is really unbelievable and so sad for our country” #CNNSOTU 
"Republicans:

Do your job. Run the damn government. Pass a budget that protects working families."
"To have a president of the United States who says such outrageous nonsense, it is really sad. "
"This government shutdown is part of the long-term, anti-government ideology paid for by the Koch brothers. "

"We're talking about the need to provide adequate disaster relief for the people of Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico – an island where hundreds of thousands are still without electricity."
We 're talking about many thousands of people with disabilities who will die because they couldn't get their claims processed in a timely manner by an underfunded and understaffed Social Security Administration.
We're talking about 27 million Americans who will find it harder and harder to get their health care through community health centers because that program has not yet been reauthorized.

"We spend much, much more on health care per capita in the United States than any other major country and yet have worse outcomes. #MedicareForAll "
".@BernieSanders #MedicareForAll National Town Hall

Patients have medications delayed under the current insurance system 😡

“I write a prescription and it gets denied but they can’t tell me why. I have to rewrite my prescriptions 4 or 5 times before the pharmacists says ok.” "
We need a health care system where people who are sick do not put off going to the doctor because they cannot afford it. #MedicareForAll
Happening now: @SenSanders holds a national town hall on why we need improved and expanded #MedicareForAll  
"""We have a healthcare system that is not designed to provide quality care. We have a healthcare system designed to make enormous profits for insurance companies &amp; drug companies."" -@SenSanders

Nurses say: It's BEYOND time we put patients over profits! #MedicareForAllTownHall "
What would it mean for your family if health care was guaranteed to all as a right? #MedicareForAll
Currently at the #MedicareForAll town hall: @SenSanders and others are discussing how our current health care system hurts small businesses  
Medicare is the most popular health insurance program in the country. #MedicareForAll
"Right now we have the absurd situation where in the last year the five largest pharmaceutical companies in America made $50 billion in profits, while millions of Americans could not afford their medication. #MedicareForAll"
"""You can stand up for people. Why wouldn't we do that for all Americans and not just people over 65?"" — Dr. Don Berwick, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services #MedicareForAll  "
"""Single-payer gets us to a place where we can worry about preventative services and not how the bill is paid."" #MedicareForAll  "
In the last 20 years alone the pharmaceutical industry has spent $3.6 billion in lobbying. They have an endless amount of money and they use it to maintain a system which allows them to raise prices as they choose. #MedicareForAll
LIVE w/ @SenSanders #MedicareForAll Townhall - RT &amp; WATCH NOW 
Our current system incentivizes employers to discriminate against older Americans because they have higher health care costs. #MedicareForAll
"The insurance companies make more money as healthcare costs rise. At the same time, they're supposed to be representing us...ostensibly for our benefit. That's a serious conflict of interest."" #MedicareForAll  "
"""We don't have to invent Medicare, we have it...It is a popular, effective program. Unfortunately it is only applicable to people over 65 or over. So the simple answer is...medicare should be available to all of us."" #MedicareForAll  "
What we are talking about exists in virtually every other major country on Earth. Think about starting a new business and not having to worry about whether your family will have health care. #MedicareForAll
"""What we are talking about exists in virtually every major country on earth."" — @SenSanders on #MedicareForAll  "
At the #MedicareForAll town hall we're discerning fact from fiction when it comes to health care in other countries.  
Why are we the only industrialized nation that doesn’t offer universal healthcare to our people? Americans have paid more than enough to hospitals and insurance companies. #MedicareForAll must be our future.

Stay tuned to  to our post coverage of @SenSanders #MedicareForAll town hall
"Norway believes that if you are sick that is stressful enough the healthcare system shouldn't add to that stress.

In Norway #SinglePayer means you don’t have to worry about cost or quality of care. They spend 2/3rds of what US spends &amp; have better health outcomes.

"We are not going to win this fight unless all of us are actively involved, stand up, fight back and recognize that health care is a right, not a privilege. #MedicareForAll"

Join me and @NYCMayor on The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook Live at 12:30 ET today. Watch at  
Here's what cable news was covering as we were discussing the most important issue facing our country. 
STARTING SOON: Join me and @NYCMayor on Facebook Live at 12:30 ET. Watch at  
LIVE NOW: What does it really mean to have a progressive government? @NYCMayor is here with me to talk it over.  
Join me and @SenSanders live to talk about how we’re working to make New York the fairest big city in America. 
"Tune in now: @NYCMayor talks about what is being done in New York to help families get child care and affordable housing:
 "
"“Let’s bring the death knell” to the fossil fuel industry, @NYCMayor says. ""Let’s prove that this is an economically unviable industry.”
 "
"""The message in New York City is that we’re going to respect everyone regardless of documentation status.” –@NYCMayor
 "
"There's no reason why we shouldn't expand Medicare to every man, woman and child in this country. All it takes is will. "
The lies that occur here in Washington about health care systems around the world are really unbelievable. 
"While Donald Trump and the ""masters of the universe"" assemble in #Davos, the 6 richest people own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population – 3.7 billion people. We need a global economy that works for all, not just multi-national corporations and the very rich."
Great to join @SenSanders at Springfield High School to discuss college and career opportunities. I encourage all VT students consider options and start planning ahead for the future. 
There is no greater example of how politics works in America than this: 
".@FaceTheNation will have @SenSanders back on the program this Sunday to discuss immigration reform, the upcoming midterm elections, and more. Tune in!  "
"Trump's position on climate change is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. We must fight back. On Jan. 31, join me and tens of thousands of people across the U.S. as we tune in to chart the path to go #FossilFree. "
"We spend far more on health care than France does, yet somehow their health outcomes are much better and they provide health care to every man, woman, and child in their country. "
"I agree with @SenatorShaheen. We need a Senate investigation to understand how this decades-long pattern of sexual assault against young gymnasts could have gone on and on. We should be supportive of our young athletes in this country, not allow them to be horribly exploited. "
".@SenSanders will join @FaceTheNation tomorrow morning. We'll ask him about the current immigration debate and the electoral outlook for Democrats. Tune in!
 "
"This is what oligarchy is all about. This is why we need to overturn the terrible Citizens United Supreme Court decision and move to public funding of elections.
"
Watch @RepRoKhanna tell Fox News why Medicare for all is the way forward when it comes to health care: 
"You know what Trump won't be talking about in his State of the Union? He will surely not be apologizing for the many lies he told American voters: how he promised to defend the interests of working people, but then sold them out to Wall Street and the billionaire class."
"¿Sabes de qué no hablará Trump en el estado de la nación? Seguramente no se disculpará por las muchas mentiras que les dijo a los votantes estadounidenses: como prometió defender los intereses de los trabajadores, pero luego los vendió a Wall Street y la clase multimillonaria."
"Republicans have decided to wage war against access to safe, affordable health care. We cannot go back to the days when women in America did not have the right to control their own bodies. Access to safe and legal abortion is a constitutional right. "
"President Trump should apologize tonight for trying to divide our nation up based on where we were born, the color of our skin, our sexual orientation and our gender. #StateOfTheUnion"
Join me tonight at 10:45 PM ET on Facebook Live for my response to President Trump's State of the Union address. I can promise you I’ll have a lot to say. 
"In some areas, like Morovis, Puerto Rico, 1/3 of the population is still without critical food and water supplies. This is unacceptable. We should not end our disaster relief until the humanitarian crisis is over. These American citizens deserve access to clean food and water. "
"En algunos lugares como Morovis, PR, 1/3 de la población sigue sin suministros de agua y alimentos. Esto es inaceptable. No deberíamos detener nuestra ayuda hasta que la crisis humanitaria haya terminado. Estos ciudadanos de EE.UU. merecen tener acceso a alimentos y agua limpios."
"""We believe in Norway that our health system is for the people of Norway and should not function as a cash cow for drug companies."" –Dr. Meetali Kakad "
"I could be wrong, but I don’t think Trump is going to be explaining tonight why he tried to throw 32 million people off of health insurance. #StateOfTheUnion"
It turns out Apple's huge announcement to invest $350 billion into the U.S. economy was just a PR move. 
Tonight Donald Trump is going to be giving his #StateOfTheUnion address. I hope you'll join me at 10:45 PM EST for my response at  
"Could this be the beginning of the American business community understanding that a not-for-profit Medicare for All, single payer system makes sense not only for the average American, but for the business community as well? "
Tonight at 10:45 ET: Sen. Sanders responds to Trump's State of the Union address on Facebook and YouTube.  
"I'm honored that Luis Alcauter will be my guest at the #StateOfTheUnion. Luis is not a statistic, and he is certainly not a bargaining chip. He is a human being who deserves our support. We cannot abandon Luis and all the other Dreamers. "
"Apple's ""major"" announcement to invest $350 billion into the U.S. economy was a major PR move. "
Starting soon: Sen. Sanders' response to #SOTU at  
President Trump’s State of the Union needs a response. Here’s mine. 
"I want to take a few minutes of your time to respond to Trump’s State of the Union speech. But I also want to talk to you about the major crises facing our country that, regrettably, Trump chose not to discuss.
#BernieResponds
 "
"Here's the story that Trump failed to mention: since March, the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion. Meanwhile, the average worker saw an increase of—are you ready for this—4 cents an hour. #BernieResponds"
"Trump touted bonuses he claims workers received because of his “tax reform” bill. He forgot to mention only 2% of Americans report getting a raise or a bonus because of the tax bill, or that corporations are now laying off tens of thousands of employees. #BernieResponds"
"Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex and Huggies, recently said they were using money from the tax cut to restructure – laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing 10 plants. #BernieResponds"
The taxpayers of this country should not be providing corporate welfare to the wealthiest families in this country. #BernieResponds
"During his campaign, Trump told the American people he was going to provide health insurance for everybody. Last year, he supported legislation that would have thrown up to 32 million people off of health insurance. #BernieResponds
 "
"Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Then he supported a Republican budget resolution that proposed slashing Medicaid by $1 trillion and cutting Medicare by $500 billion. #BernieResponds
 "
Trump talked about how he was going to lower prescription drug prices and take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Then he nominated a former top executive of one of the largest drug companies for Secretary of Health and Human Services. #BernieResponds 
"Trump told us that “the rich will not be gaining at all” under his tax plan. That was quite a whopper. The legislation Trump signed into law provides 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. #BernieResponds
 "
Trump talked about how he was going to take on the greed of Wall Street which he said “has caused tremendous problems for us.” Then he appointed more Wall Street billionaires to his administration than any president in history. #BernieResponds 
I don’t understand how a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change. #BernieResponds
"How can Trump not talk about the fact that in a highly competitive global economy, hundreds of thousands of bright young people are unable to afford to go to college, while millions of others have come out of school deeply in debt? #BernieResponds"
How can a president not talk about the inadequate funding and staffing at the Social Security Administration which has resulted in thousands of people with disabilities dying because they did not get their claims processed in time? #BernieResponds
"How can Trump not talk about the reality that Russia, through cyberwarfare, interfered in our election in 2016, is interfering in democratic elections all over the world, and according to his own CIA director will likely interfere in the 2018 midterm elections? #BernieResponds"
"Trump talked about DACA and immigration, but what he did not tell the American people is that he precipitated this crisis in September by repealing President Obama’s executive order protecting Dreamers. #BernieResponds"
We need to seriously address the issue of immigration but that does not mean dividing families and reducing legal immigration by 25-50 percent. #BernieResponds
"It would be unspeakable and a moral stain on our nation if we turned our backs on the 800,000 young Dreamers who were born and raised in this country and who know no other home but the United States. #BernieResponds"
Poll after poll shows that over 80 percent of the American people believe that we should protect the legal status of Dreamers and provide them with a path toward citizenship. We need to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act now. #BernieResponds
President Trump’s State of the Union needs a response. Here’s mine. 
Trump’s plan to privatize our nation’s infrastructure is an old idea that has never worked and never will work. #BernieResponds
"Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis. Well, I say to him, you don’t help people suffering from opioid addiction by cutting Medicaid by $1 trillion. We need to expand, not cut Medicaid. #BernieResponds"
"The American people do not want a president who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation. #BernieResponds"
The good news is that the vast majority of our people have a very different vision for the future of our country than what Trump and the Republican leadership are giving us. #BernieResponds
"In an unprecedented way, we are witnessing a revitalization of American democracy with more and more people standing up and fighting back. #BernieResponds"
"We are seeing the growth of grassroots organizations and people from every conceivable background starting to run for office – for school board, city council, state legislature, the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. #BernieResponds"
We are starting to see the beginning of a political revolution. Candidates from coast to coast are standing tall for a progressive agenda that works for the working families of our country and not just the billionaire class.  #BernieResponds
The Koch brothers and their billionaire friends plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2018 midterm elections. They may have the money. But we have the people. #BernieResponds
"When ordinary people stand up and fight for justice there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. That has been the history of America, and that is our future. #BernieResponds"
Canadians are sick and tired of Republicans lying about their health care. 
"Last night we heard President Trump’s State of the Union, but what we did not hear was a single mention of climate change. Tonight, join me and tens of thousands of people across the U.S. as we tune in to chart the path to go #FossilFree.

"Donald Trump spoke for over an hour last night on many issues, yet somehow he forgot to mention the words ""climate change."" He continues to believe that climate change is a “hoax.” What an outrage. #FossilFree

"The American people want a government, an economy, an environment that works for all of us, not just the few. #FossilFree"

“Let me respond to the State of the Union” by @SenSanders 
This is the health care crisis no one is talking about. Congress must act immediately to fully fund community health centers. 
"It’s been over 4 months since funding for Community Health Centers expired. 26 million Americans, including 300,000 Wisconsinites rely on community health centers to get the care they need. We have to take action to fund them now.
"
What is Trump afraid of? According to news reports President Trump himself has acknowledged that the release of the Nunes memo was designed to disrupt Robert Mueller’s investigation. No political stunt should interfere with the special counsel’s work.
The fact that Congressional Republicans and the White House would release a memo the FBI itself says is misleading is a sad example of a political party putting partisanship above patriotism.
The release of the Nunes memo is a blatant attempt by House Republicans and the White House to disrupt the critically important investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
"We need to build a health care system that puts the lives of patients over the whims and profits of insurance companies, where being poor or unemployed or just unlucky doesn’t mean a death sentence.
"
"We've lost 900,000 jobs in two decades thanks to NAFTA. The status quo must change. "
This Canadian doctor can't believe how complicated and dysfunctional our health care system is: 
"Sen. Sanders is seeking a full-time, paid press/video fellow. See here for details: "
"Hey, Mr. President. The only people who love the current system are you, the drug companies and insurance companies. 30 million Americans have no health insurance and we pay the highest prices in the world.  We must guarantee health care to all, not take it away. "
We know how important the early years of a child's life are. Why would we not make sure all children have access to high-quality learning programs like Head Start? 
"As if workers' earnings weren't low enough already, President Trump now wants to make it legal for employers to steal workers' tips. "
"Getting rid of gerrymandered districts is an important step in the fight against voter suppression, but we must go further. It is past time to restore the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting and implement automatic voter registration. "
"We need a new moral agenda where the poor and middle-class are lifted up, not left behind. "
"It is time for Congress to investigate the opioid crisis, to learn what the drug companies knew about these products and to hold them accountable. "
"Norway ranks #3 out of 11 countries when it comes to health care outcomes, while Canada ranks #9. Guess who comes in last? "
Sen. Bernie Sanders compares Big Pharma to Big Tobacco over the spread of addictive opioids 
Yesterday Trump suggested that members of Congress who don't mindlessly stand and applaud his every word are guilty of “treason.” The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
"Our job is to remind Trump and his allies what democracy is all about. By our grassroots activism we will defend President Lincoln's words “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth."""
The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican or progressive vs. conservative. It's much deeper than that. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism. 
"Despite Jeff Sessions' war on marijuana, a growing majority of the American people understand that we should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse progress that has been made. "
"Just as we called on tobacco companies to testify about what they knew and when they knew it, we must demand that drug companies testify under oath about their knowledge of opioids’ addictiveness."
High-income countries around the world have figured out how to do universal health care. Why can't Republicans understand that? 
"It’s time for Congress to step up and, like Alabama and other states, investigate the pharmaceutical industry. The manufacturers of opioids should be forced to testify before Congress and tell us what they knew about the addictiveness of opioids. "
"Hey, Mr. President: Instead of copying France's military parade, why not copy France's health care system?  Health care for all, low-cost prescription drugs, much less expensive. "
Watch this progressive Congresswoman @RepJayapal explain what fair immigration reform means on Fox News: 
"Our country desperately needs #paidleave, but we shouldn't rob Peter to pay Paul. Any plan that cuts into Social Security will hit low-income workers, seniors, and women the hardest. That's wrong.

Congress should work to strengthen Social Security, and pass the #FAMILYAct."
.@SpeakerRyan: A bi-partisan majority of House members support strong legislation to protect Dreamers. Let them vote. Let democracy rule.
"Thank you to the @nwlc for your strong advocacy on this issue. All families must have access to affordable child care, and that is why we just doubled funding to expand child care and development in America. "
"Senate Deal Includes Historic Investment in Child Care.

Thanks, @SenWarren  @SenSanders  @PattyMurray  @SenSchumer !

Doubling of #CCDBG will help 230,000 children whose hard-working parents struggle to afford quality #childcare.  #bthru8 #ece

  "
"Second, the $165 billion increase in defense spending is much too large. I believe in a strong military, but at a time when the U.S. spends more on defense than the next 12 countries combined, the last thing we should do is massively increase the Pentagon’s budget."
"However, I will be voting no. This bill does not address the great moral issue of our time – the fact that in three weeks 800,000 young Dreamers will lose their legal status and be subject to deportation."
"I'm proud of initiatives I fought for in the budget agreement that increase funding for child care, the Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, community health centers, student debt relief, our crumbling infrastructure, the opioid epidemic and disaster recovery."
Access to affordable home energy is not a luxury. It is a matter of life and death. No American should go cold in the wintertime. Trump must fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program at no less than $5.1 billion in his upcoming budget. 
"We must not allow our younger generation to have a lower standard of living than their parents. One way to create good paying jobs is to grow the trade union movement and fight for decent wages and benefits.
"
"Scott Pruitt, the head of the EPA, thinks that climate change could potentially be good for humans. Does he also think an asteroid hitting the Earth would be good for humans? "
".@SenSanders is sitting down with the German ambassador, Pete Wittig to discuss what we can learn from our European friends in terms of health care, immigration, and the work force. "
"The Trump budget is morally bankrupt and bad economic policy. It pays for his tax breaks for the rich and large corporations by slashing Medicaid by $1.3 trillion, cutting Medicare by $554 billion and slicing $10 billion from the Social Security Disability Insurance Program."
"Trump is right to talk about the need to rebuild our infrastructure, but his proposal is dead wrong. Trump would encourage states to sell our nation’s highways, bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street and saddle Americans with new tolls and fees."
"Instead of creating more giveaways to corporate America, we should be eliminating corporate tax loopholes and using this revenue to directly invest over $1 trillion to modernize our nation’s infrastructure and create 15 million good-paying jobs."
"If you were wondering how Trump plans to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires and corporations, now you know: with $1.8 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
The Trump budget is morally bankrupt. It is nothing less than an attack on the poor and a major transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 1 percent. 
"The Trump budget is the budget of the Koch brothers, of the billionaire class."
"As a candidate, Donald Trump said he understood the pain that working families were feeling.

Well, you’re not responding to that pain, Mr. President, when you kick 500,000 families out of their homes by gutting affordable housing programs."
You’re not a “different” kind of Republican by proposing a budget that would eliminate heating assistance to 6 million families in this country by abolishing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
You don’t help working people when your budget would eliminate financial aid to hundreds of thousands of low-income college students.
"You don’t help working families by throwing more than 100,000 kids off of Head Start."
Fox News is afraid that the American people will find out the truth about Canada's single-payer health care. 
“Our job is NOT to allow Trump and his friends to privatize the VA. Our job is to strengthen the VA.” @SenSanders  
"Congress should be focusing on two issues when it comes to immigration, @SenSanders tells @jeremyhobson: a path toward citizenship for 1.8 million DACA-eligible immigrants, and improved border security.  "
"One of the great crises we face is the rise of authoritarianism. Whether it's Putin, Trump, Duterte or Viktor Orban in Hungary, we are seeing attacks against freedom of the press, democratic election laws and an independent judiciary. "
Why does Mick Mulvaney think it's OK to cut heating assistance for low-income Americans while giving massive tax breaks to the Koch brothers? 
"Donald Trump will receive a tax break of up to $11 million a year as a result of the Republican tax plan he signed into law.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s budget would eliminate after school programs for more than 1 million children."
Ready for a really bad idea? Gut funding for studying and tracking climate change while boosting the continued burning of planet-warming fossil fuels. 
Happy Valentine's day to all the millionaires who will not have to pay into Social Security for the rest of the year. Let's lift the cap and end this absurdity. 
"This whole debate over immigration and the Dreamers has become somewhat personal for me, because it has reminded me… "
"I do not want to see what the history books will say about this Congress if we allow 800,000 Dreamers to be deported. It would be an indelible moral stain on our country if we fail to act."
"As a result of Trump’s decision to revoke DACA, 122 people every day are losing their legal status. We have a moral responsibility today to stand up for the Dreamers and their families."
"You can't get 80 percent of the American people to agree on what type of ice cream is best, and yet you have an even larger majority now who agree on giving Dreamers protection and a path towards citizenship."
"Congratulations to gold-medalist @chloekimsnow, a first-generation American. Her father emigrated from South Korea to America in 1982 and worked his way up to an engineering job which he left to support her ambitions. "
Don't just weep. Fight for a progressive agenda to reduce income and wealth inequality. 
"Maybe, just maybe, after 18 school shootings in America in just 43 days of 2018 the Congress might want to consider common-sense gun safety legislation and save innocent lives."
Another horrific shooting. Another unspeakable horror. My thoughts are with everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after this terrible day.
"I thank German Ambassador @AmbWittig for joining me in Vermont this past weekend. I have always believed it is important for us to learn about what goes on in other countries, and there is plenty to be learned from Germany. "
President Trump's immoral budget will cut Social Security benefits for millions of hardworking Americans. And that means he lied to the American people. 
"If Republicans actually listened to those in need, like Cara Sachs, maybe they would understand that ""entitlement reform"" will devastate the lives of millions of Americans. "
We should not be selling assault weapons in this country. These weapons are not for hunting. They are for killing human beings. These are military weapons.
"We must take on the NRA and pass commonsense legislation to keep our children safe.


-Tighten background checks

-End the gun show loophole

-Crack down on people who buy guns legally for people who can’t

-Ban civilian sale of semiautomatic assault weapons"
"Will the Republicans in Congress listen to the American people, or simply obey the dictates of the NRA?
"
Happy to be home in Burlington. It's a warm and pleasant afternoon on Lake Champlain. #Vermont  
"I agree with Bill Gates. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the last thing Congress should do is give huge tax breaks to billionaires. The very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less.

Do you have a personal story to share about your or your family’s struggle to get by in today's economy? We want to hear from ordinary Americans who have experienced in their daily lives the consequences of an economy that leaves far too many behind. 
"I'm proud that the Vermont Senate voted to raise the state minimum wage to $15/hour, which will give a much–needed raise to more than 65,000 Vermonters. I will continue to fight for a $15 federal minimum wage, because no worker in America should earn starvation wages."
"I would hope that because of the leadership of these young people, we can stop the slaughter of children in our schools. I applaud these kids immensely for standing up and speaking out. "
"Last year Amazon's federal income tax rate was zero. That was apparently too much for my Republican colleagues. Under the Trump tax bill, Amazon will get an additional $789 million tax break on the profits they shifted to offshore tax havens. "
We want to hear from ordinary Americans who have experienced in their daily lives the consequences of an economy that leaves far too many behind. Please share your story. 
"Working people in this country need a seat at the bargaining table to fight for higher wages, decent health care, a secure retirement and a safe working environment. Public sector unions are that voice and the Supreme Court must not take that away.

"An important thread about how even people with health insurance struggle to pay for health care. We must move to Medicare for all and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege. "
"Thank you to the students from Parkland, Florida, who are doing everything they can to prevent another mass shooting like they experienced. These really are incredibly bright young people. Because of them, I think it's possible we are going to see real change. "
"Nobody thinks the issue of gun safety is going to be an easy issue to solve. But in some ways I think the shooting in Florida is going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.

"The Parkland students went through an unbelievably traumatic experience. But because they are prepared not just to mourn, but to stand up and fight back, I think it's possible we are going to see real change. "
"2) We must crack down on ""straw men"" purchasers, when people legally buy guns and then sell them to people who cannot get them legally."
"1) We must seriously strengthen universal background checks, including ending the gun show loophole. Background checks don't mean anything if somebody can go into a gun show or the internet and buy weapons without undergoing any background check."
The American people are demanding that we have the courage to stand up to the NRA and finally take some action to move us in the right direction on gun safety. Let me suggest some of the ways in which I believe we should go forward in a bipartisan way.
I hope that in a bipartisan way we can come together and do what the overwhelming majority of American people want us to do: pass commonsense gun safety legislation to keep our children and families safe.
"5) Finally, we must make it easier for law enforcement to keep guns away from those accused of domestic violence or under a restraining order."
4) We need to provide more resources for those with mental health issues and make it harder for people with red flags to obtain weapons. People who are suffering from a mental health crisis should be able to get the health care they need.
3) We should reinstate the ban on assault weapons in this country—weapons which are designed for no other purpose but to kill human beings.

"At 4:30 PM today, @SenMikeLee @ChrisMurphyCT and I will introduce a joint resolution calling for an end to U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen. Tune in: "
It is unconstitutional for the United States to continue its involvement in the war in Yemen without Congressional approval.  
"Without Congressional authorization, our engagement in the war in Yemen should be restricted to providing desperately needed humanitarian aid, and diplomatic efforts to resolve it."
We have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in determining when and where our country goes to war.
"Every 10 minutes, a child under the age of five dies of preventable causes in Yemen. What few Americans know, however, is that the U.S. military is making the crisis worse by helping one side in the conflict bomb innocent civilians. "
"A Washington crime and cover-up has triggered the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Call 1-833-786-7927 to tell your Senator to join @SenSanders &amp; @SenMikeLee to end a secretive, unconstitutional U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen. Together, we can help save millions of lives. #StopTheWar "
"Why Congress must vote on the United States’ role in Yemen  by @SenMikeLee, @SenSanders &amp; @ChrisMurphyCT"
"This is why they needed a trillion dollars in tax cuts — not to create jobs, but to concentrate even more wealth in the hands of a few. "
"If the president or members of Congress believe that support for the war in Yemen is in the U.S. interest, and that we should be involved in it, let them come before Congress, make their case, and let us vote on it.
 "

"Workers earning $7.25 an hour must work an extra 41 days just to make the same amount they did in 2009, the last time Congress raised the federal minimum wage. It is way past time we take action and pay workers a living wage of $15 an hour.

Why would any member of Congress vote to move us closer to another taxpayer bailout of large financial institutions? 
The US has nearly 17 times the gun homicide rate of Germany. So what's the difference? Our gun laws. 
This banking bill is a disaster. The Wall Street crash of 2008 showed the American people how fraudulent many of these large banks are. The last thing we should be doing is deregulating them. 
These guys in the pharmaceutical industry in my humble opinion are crooks. 
"Are our memories so short that we have learned nothing from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression just 10 years ago? Unbelievably, Congress now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster."
"At a time of massive concentration of ownership in the financial sector, now is not the time to deregulate banks that have more than $3.5 trillion in assets and lay the groundwork for another massive financial collapse."
Today my Republican colleagues along with some Democrats tell us that we should be spending our time deregulating some of the largest banks in America. How absurd is that?  
"I hear from a lot of people in Vermont and around the country. I have not heard one person say, ""Bernie, we have got to deregulate 25 of the largest banks in this country with cumulative assets of $3.5 trillion."" Yet that is what Congress is debating doing today."
"Why is Congress busy worrying about the needs of huge financial institutions, but ignores the concerns of ordinary Americans? The answer is simple. Follow the money."
"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions, and last year spent over $200 million on lobbying. That is why Congress will be spending day after day trying to make life easier for large financial institutions."
"I have a radical idea. Instead of listening to lobbyists in Washington, maybe, just maybe, we should listen to the American people who believe we should strengthen, not weaken, Wall Street regulations."
Here is why I am opposing the bill being voted on in the Senate now to deregulate some of the largest banks in America. 
"I am excited to have @keithellison take the lead in the House on the fight to pass a Medicare-for-all health care system. With his leadership, I know we will be able to take on the greed of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies and finally guarantee health care to all. "
"The Koch brothers and other right-wing groups are trying to destroy unions in America, and that's exactly what the Janus Supreme Court case is about. "
Bernie Sanders slams defense contractor CEO pay 
"#Teamsters Pres. Jim #Hoffa sat down today with @SenSanders to discuss the top issues facing the #union including the looming pension crisis, trade and the threat that the Supreme Court case of #JanusvAFSCME poses to public employees across the nation. "
"Does it make sense that we pay the Secretary of Defense $200,000 or less and we give a contractor, who gets 92 percent of his revenue from the taxpayers of this country, $18 million in taxpayer money?
"
"What issue do you think got more coverage on CNN today, the effort to deregulate the major banks or Donald Trump and a porn star? Think hard! "
A multinational corporation taking huge sums of money from taxpayers should not be paying workers starvation wages. I stand with the workers who are fighting back against low wages and wage theft. 
"Charles Koch to Paul Ryan: Here's $500K for giving me a massive tax cut at working families' expense.

Also Charles Koch: “When large companies can pressure politicians to force everyday Americans to fork over unearned millions, we should all question the fairness of the system.”"
Bernie Sanders to hold televised town hall on economic inequality

Firing the secretary of state by tweet is no way to run a foreign policy. Countries around the world are looking to the U.S. for signs of stability and leadership. Trump is sending the opposite message. 
"Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, or that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war.
 "

"For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war. That is the debate we are going to have today. "
Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the issue of war 
"The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war."
"I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked “Made in the USA,"" dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military."
"So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen:
-Over 10,000 civilians have been killed
-Over 3 million have been displaced
-15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation
-More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported"
Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
"LBJ’s administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War.

Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth."
"The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse."
6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity – in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
"I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences."
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help."
"What was the corporate media discussing while we were talking about inequality in America? Let me guess, Stormy Daniels. "
"What frightens me is not only Trump's respect and admiration for tyrants all over the world, but his disrespect for democracy in our country.

Our job is to stand together and say: Mr. Trump, in this country we believe in democracy, not authoritarianism. "

The American people are tired of our broken health care system. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans know that we can do better and that we should pass Medicare for all to finally make health care a right. 
"And after providing a massive tax break for the wealthy that will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, Trump complains about the domestic spending initiatives secured by the Democratic Caucus to address the needs of working families and the middle class."
"After rescinding the DACA program in September and opposing every piece of legislation to help the Dreamers, Trump blames Democrats for a problem that he created."
This was probably one of the most bizarre press conferences a president has ever had. Trump's hypocrisy and ignorance is no longer laughable. It is frightening. 
"It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system. "
John Bolton is the next National Security Advisor. That should scare everyone. Here are four reasons why: 
I want to congratulate everyone who is participating in the #MarchForOurLives today. Congress must have the guts to listen to the vast majority of the American people and not just the NRA. 
"Transgender people have served and continue to serve our country honorably in the military. Unfortunately, this administration is not treating them honorably. The struggle for equality for all Americans continues, and Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed."
The Trump administration has shown once again that it is on the wrong side of history. There is a reason the administration has not provided any scientific evidence to justify this policy: there is no justification for this sort of discrimination. 
It's a beautiful day for the #MarchForOurLives in Montpelier. Thank you to the young people who are leading us today.

"The struggle at the VA is about Trump's desire to privatize the VA and his belief that Shulkin is not moving fast enough in that direction. The Senate Veterans Committee, on which I serve, must stand with the veterans of our country and oppose all efforts to privatize the VA. "

"Dr. David Shulkin, who has just been fired by Trump as Secretary of the VA, is right. We must not allow the VA to be privatized. Our job is to strengthen the VA, not dismember it.

"How absurd is it that we live in a country where Congress and many states give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, but fail to provide adequate funding for education?"
The killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic. It is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response.
"Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains a humanitarian disaster. The U.S. must play a more positive role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all."
The situation in Gaza is desperate. The unrest in Gaza will not end until the people there see hope for a decent future. The U.S. must work to bring Israel and the Palestinians together to end the blockade and develop policies that works for all. 
"Somebody told me that West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky are ""red"" states. They got that wrong. These are the states where teachers are now leading the nation in the fight for workers' rights and adequate funding for education. Thank you teachers! "
Let us never forget that at the time of his death Martin Luther King was organizing a multi-racial Poor People's Campaign and that he was assassinated in Memphis as he supported sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions.
I'll join civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Dr. King was not only one of the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was also at the forefront of the fight for economic justice.
"50 years ago today Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a speech in Memphis, Tennessee as he stood in solidarity with sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions. Listen to the speech here:
"
"In the richest country in the history of the world, our teachers should be the best-paid in the developed world, not among the worst-paid. The teachers who are protesting now are an inspiration to all of us. "

Pompeo supports the use of torture. He has longstanding relationships with anti-Muslim extremists. And his hawkish views on Iran and North Korea could very well lead us into another disastrous war. I will vote no on his nomination.
"Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice for secretary of state. He is a supporter of the Global Gag Rule. He opposes LGBTQ rights. And as the top recipient of money from the Koch brothers, he's stymied action on one of our most serious security threats: global climate change."
It's not a radical idea to say that women should get equal pay for equal work and the same economic opportunities as men. This is an issue of basic justice. #EqualPayDay

"Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the Senate is a good first step, but nowhere near enough. Today’s hearing must be the beginning, not the end, of the discussion about the dramatic impact Facebook, technology companies and the internet at large play in our society."
"This nation needs a serious conversation about the proper role of these companies. Should Facebook, Google and Amazon be allowed to control so much of the internet? How do ordinary citizens benefit from the internet without seeing an invasion of their personal lives?"
"Companies today know every aspect of a person’s life—where they go, what they do, their medical and financial records, whom they talk to, what they buy—and use that information to make billions in profit."
"While the internet has been an enormous source for good, all that convenience and connection comes with a price. Our privacy has been invaded in an unprecedented way and in a manner that would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago."
This is an issue that impacts virtually every American. The American people have a right to know how companies are profiting from our information.
Mark Zuckerberg testified today about Facebook’s role in our democracy. Here are the most important questions we should ask concerning his testimony: 
Do we really want to live in a country where students have to go to the hospital because of stress over paying for college? Or should we make public colleges and universities tuition-free while also lowering the outrageous levels of student debt? 
"President Trump has no legal authority for broadening the war in Syria. It is Congress, not the president, who determines whether our country goes to war, and Congress must not abdicate that responsibility. "
"My team reviewed the shareholder calls from 10 of the largest pharma companies—not one said they'd use their windfall from Trump's tax cuts to lower drug prices. Instead they announced billions in stock buybacks. It's unacceptable.

This takeaway from the Mark Zuckerberg hearing gets to the heart of the issue: how do we use Facebook and the internet without seeing an invasion of our personal privacy? 
"Thank you @SenSanders for opposing hateful, racist, Koch Brothers-extremist Mike Pompeo! We cannot have a climate denier in international climate talks.

Billionaires get tax breaks. Teachers get broken chairs and flooded classrooms. As the wealthiest nation in history we've got to do better. 
"Whether Trump likes it or not, it is Congress, not the president, who determines whether our country goes to war. Congress must not abdicate that responsibility. "
"Five years ago, could you have believed that half of Americans would agree we need a single-payer health care system?

"In a series of broken promises Trump made to the working people of this country, rejoining the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the biggest yet. Rejoining the TPP would be a betrayal of American workers and a step in the wrong direction. "
American workers should not be forced into a race to the bottom. They should not have to compete against manufacturing workers in Vietnam who make as little as 72 cents an hour.
Make no mistake about it: Trump is dead wrong. There is no way to resuscitate the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership without betraying the working families of our country. 
"Trade is a good thing, but it must be fair. Instead of rejoining the TPP, we must fundamentally rewrite our failed trade policies in order to raise living standards for American workers and workers throughout the world."
"Trump is right that it would be useful to take a serious look at the Postal Service. He's dead wrong, however, if he believes the solution is to privatize the Postal Service. The reality is that since 2014 the Postal Service has made an operating profit of more than $2.7 billion. "
"If the Postal Service is going to be a vibrant entity, we must end this Bush-era mandate. We must also allow the Postal Service to raise new revenue by offering innovative new services that the American people need, including basic banking services."
The main reason for the financial problems at the Postal Service stems from a 2006 mandate forcing it to pre-fund 75-years of retiree health benefits to employees who haven’t been born yet. No other business or government agency is burdened with such an absurd requirement.
"One of my great fears is that President Trump, through a combination of arrogance, ignorance and incompetence, will get the United States into another war. "

Bernie Sanders is introducing opioid legislation today that goes directly after the drug manufacturers and would impose fines of up to $7.8 billion 
Today I'm introducing legislation to hold the pharmaceutical companies and executives that created the opioid crisis accountable for the extraordinary harm they have caused.

"Congratulations to the JetBlue crew members who overwhelmingly voted to join the Transportation Workers Union. This is a significant victory for JetBlue workers, for the labor movement and for our country. "
We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. It's time to repeal the Trump tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class. #TaxDay
Today on #TaxDay Americans around the country are standing up against a Republican tax plan that looks out for the ultra-wealthy while leaving working families behind. 
The Republican tax bill gives 83% of its benefits to the Top 1%. That'd be bad enough. But there's more in there to hurt workers. It incentivizes corporations to outsource jobs.

Big surprise. It turns out a lot of Trump's talk about his tax cuts is a lie. Here are some of his most egregious claims: 
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to earn what the CEO makes in a year. Corporate greed has got to end. No more paying workers starvation wages.

"I voted against Pompeo because we need a secretary of state who'll check Trump’s bellicose nature, not encourage it. After 15+ years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, we need someone who will bring nations together in diplomatic efforts, not someone who supports never-ending wars."
"And we need a secretary of state who will address the crisis of climate change, not stymie action on one of the world’s most serious security threats.

President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is the latest in a series of reckless decisions that move our country closer to conflict.

Happy Mother's Day to Jane and all the mothers of this country. 
"TOWN HALL TONIGHT: Do you have a question you want to ask the panel at tonight's town hall on Trump's decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal? Leave a response below.
 "
Join @SenSanders for a live town hall on the Iran Deal withdrawal this today. @TheYoungTurks will stream it at 7pm ET. Watch at  or through TYT Plus in the iOS app store. Stick around after the town hall for a special panel analysis.
"By ending the nuclear deal, has Trump put America on the path to war? Join us to discuss that question and more tonight at 7 pm ET. "
Watch the town hall on Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal live here at 7 pm ET: 
"The United States must play an aggressive role in bringing Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and the international community together to address Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and stop this escalating violence."
"Over 50 killed in Gaza today and 2,000 wounded, on top of the 41 killed and more than 9,000 wounded over the past weeks. This is a staggering toll. Hamas violence does not justify Israel firing on unarmed protesters."
"Looking forward to joining @SenSanders, @LaraFriedmanDC, @Rob_Malley and @suzannedimaggio tonight to discuss life after the president’s violation of the #IranDeal. "
"You can’t make this stuff up. Trump promised over and over again that he would bring back American jobs that have been outsourced to China. Instead of working to bring back outsourced jobs, he is now pledging to help create jobs in China. "

John Bolton really has chutzpah. First Bolton urges George W. Bush to invade Iraq and now he is moving our country closer to conflict with Iran. We are on a very dangerous path.

"For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians alike, the United States must act urgently to help relieve the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. "
We need to stop imprisoning people for smoking marijuana and start prosecuting the crooks on Wall Street whose greed and illegal behavior caused the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.
The Senate votes today on whether to overturn the FCC’s #NetNeutrality ruling. There’s never been a more important vote in the Senate for the future of the internet. with @freepress 
"We're not a free society without a free and open internet. Without #NetNeutrality, our democracy could be in trouble. with @demandprogress "
"The repeal of #NetNeutrality hands the internet over to a handful of corporations while people of color, low-income families, disabled communities and rural towns get pushed offline. with @mediajustice "
Nearly 40 percent of rural Americans lack high speed broadband. Repealing #NetNeutrality would make a bad situation worse for rural America. with @ilsr 
"Up to 20% of incarcerated people in America are imprisoned because they lack the money to pay cash bail or fines for minor violations.

Let me say that again. Some 400,000 people are incarcerated today for crimes they haven't been convicted of. That is insane."
"Millions of people are given excessive parole, probation or sentences, whose lives are destroyed while taxpayers pay millions to lock people up. If we are going to address mass incarceration that has got to change. "
The Senate just took an important step toward reversing the Trump administration’s disastrous decision to repeal #NetNeutrality. Now the House must side with the 86% of Americans who support net neutrality and pass this resolution to protect our free speech and democracy.
"Congratulations, President Trump, on being the first president in history whose speech on ""bringing down drug prices"" sent pharma stocks soaring. "
The United States Senate just voted to repeal the disastrous FCC decision to end #NetNeutrality. We must demand that the House does the right thing and stands with the Senate to overturn this decision. 
"We are dealing with a crisis of inequality and that is why we must start making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, not give more breaks to those at the top. "
It is not a radical idea to say that every American citizen over the age of 18 should be automatically registered to vote.
"The three wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent — over 160 million people. Meanwhile, almost half of families in America can't afford basic necessities. Is that really the kind of society we want to be living in? "
"There's little left to be said about the horrific school shooting tragedies that we've seen over and over – today in Texas. These are very sick acts.

Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA and do what the American people want. Enough is enough! "
"The American people, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, overwhelmingly support common sense gun safety legislation. It's time to act."
This is the latest disgraceful attack on women’s rights by the Trump administration. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people around this country. 
"I always find it curious that ""conservatives"" tell us how much they want to get the government off the backs of the people. But when it comes to women and family planning, they want to the government to tell every woman in America what she can and cannot do with her body."
"In Vermont, Planned Parenthood is the only provider of Title X services, and without federal funding, their ability to serve thousands of low-income Vermonters will be seriously limited."
There's a three-letter word stopping us from passing common sense gun safety legislation: NRA.

"Thank you @amazonnews for your response to our video. I remain deeply concerned about Amazon, an enormously profitable corporation, paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to depend on federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and public housing for survival. "
"At a time of exploding profits, I would hope that @Amazon would pay everyone who works in your fulfillment centers a living wage. Thank you very much for your invitation to visit a fulfillment center. I look forward to doing that. Let’s work out a mutually convenient time."
"How sad is it that we now have students in this country who are expecting violence in their schools. As Congresswoman @RosaDelauro says, the Congress must stand up to the NRA and pass gun safety legislation. Enough is enough. "
"I am concerned that despite some very good provisions in the VA MISSION Act, it continues a trend toward the slow, steady privatization of the VA. I will vote against it."
"At a time when banks have never been more profitable, Congress voted yesterday to give them another massive gift in the form of deregulation. Our job is to break up the largest financial institutions in the country, not reward their greed and recklessness. "
President Trump: you are not improving health care when you deny funding to Planned Parenthood and deny millions of women their provider of health care. Stop the attack on women's health. 
"With the apparent cancellation of the summit, the Trump administration should now commit itself to working with our allies in Asia and the international community on a genuine diplomatic strategy to remove the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons."
"From the beginning, when Trump impulsively decided that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, it has been clear that the summit involved very little preparation. The threat of North Korea’s nuclear program is a very serious issue that requires serious diplomacy. "
"If Finland and other Nordic countries can make child care affordable and accessible to all, the United States should be able to as well. "
I have serious concerns when you have a president of the United States who is constantly trying to undermine democratic institutions. That is wrong and together we must fight back. 
"Instead of spending $20 billion to raise the minimum wage at Walmart to $16.66 an hour, Walmart is putting more money in the pockets of their wealthy shareholders.

This is what corporate greed looks like. "
"When Trump tells us the economy is ""booming,"" please remember:
- Over 40% of Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency expense
- 43% can't afford the basics to live
- Over 25% of adults skipped necessary medical care last year because they couldn't afford it"
"Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, create up to 15 million good jobs rebuilding America, expand Social Security, enact Medicare for all, and make it easier for workers to join unions."
"Memorial Day is a time to pay special tribute to service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice and to honor and support their families. We should be united in commemorating the sacrifices of those who gave, as Lincoln said, “the last full measure of devotion” to our country."
You want to talk about what it means to be anti-wealth? Jeff Bezos capturing $133 billion in wealth while paying his workers starvation wages for backbreaking work is anti-wealth. 
"We cannot forget that the people of Puerto Rico, who are American citizens, are still suffering from the devastation of Hurricane Maria and need our help. "

I have a feeling ABC will not be asking on its nightly news program tonight how Disney can make $9 billion in profits while three-quarters of Disneyland employees can’t afford basic living expenses.
"Trump’s haphazard and reckless plan to impose tariffs on Canada and the European Union is an absolute disaster that will cause unnecessary economic pain to farmers, manufacturers and consumers in Vermont and around the country."
"I strongly support imposing penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to stop illegal dumping of steel and aluminum. But it makes no sense to start a trade war with Canada, the EU and others who are engaged in fair trade and pay workers a living wage."
"We are joining Disneyland workers today to say: If Disney can afford to pay its CEO up to $423 million, it can afford to pay all of its workers a living wage. "

Over the next decade we will spend nearly $1 trillion jailing our fellow citizens. Imagine what we could accomplish if we reduced that number by 10 or 20 percent? 
"I want to hear the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits, $400 million for their CEO and has a 30-year worker going hungry. "
This is not what Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse are supposed to be about. Disney must pay all of its workers a living wage.

We have to decide as a nation whether information about what we do with our lives should be sold to companies that will exploit that information.
What is the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits and pays a 30-year employee so little that she goes hungry?

But we are not. We're the richest country in the history of the world. We can and must make health care a right to all."

"Disney makes $9 billion in profits, gives its CEO over $400 million and yet Disneyland workers can't afford to put a roof over their heads. "
I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We need to ask this very hard question: is a perpetual war necessary to keep us safe?

"Trump's war on the poor continues. First he wants to throw millions off nutrition assistance and Medicaid, and now he's going after affordable housing. Trump's agenda is simple: tax breaks for the rich, devastating cuts for the poor. We must fight back and create a moral economy. "
"We all hope that the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is successful. Getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons through a credible process would be a major step forward for world peace. But when Trump praises Kim as “very honorable,” he makes a mockery of American values."
"Disney's CEO said the company had a ""great quarter."" Disneyland employees who can't afford rent or food beg to differ. "
"Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst @Judgenap agrees with me: It is Congress' responsibility to decide when to put our young men and women in harm's way, not the president. "
A billionaire shouldn't have any more of a right to run for office than a working stiff who can't afford to raise the millions of dollars needed for a campaign. 
"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations who shut down in the United States and send jobs abroad to low-wage countries, we must invest in creating worker-owned companies."
"Employee-owned companies won't provide starvation wages to workers and huge compensation packages to CEOs. They will not shut down and send their own jobs to China. In fact, study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, sales and wages."
"In their never-ending quest to throw millions off health insurance and raise premiums, the Trump Administration is now arguing in court that it should be legal for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. That is a disgrace."
More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the “happiest place on Earth” to me. 
Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country.

"Pope Francis is right. We must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transform our energy system to renewable energy. If we do not, the consequences will be catastrophic.

"It's a travesty that the Supreme Court upheld Ohio’s voter suppression efforts. Instead of making people jump through hoops to vote, states should pass automatic voter registration and same-day registration. Politicians afraid of large voter turnouts are political cowards. "

Port truck drivers are cheated out of an estimated $850 million a year. They're driving for 20 hours a day and taking home paychecks worth nothing. They are denied health care and overtime pay. This is modern-day slavery.

Why does Trump's health secretary care more about protecting the profits of the drug industry than the lives of Americans who can’t afford the highest prescription drug prices in the world? 
"This merger represents a gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good. At a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less. "
"To afford a two-bedroom apartment, a worker making the federal minimum wage would need to work 122 hours a week. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage and that has got to change. "

"The Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of separating children, including infants as young as one year old, from their parents at the border is inhumane, cruel and an affront to our values as Americans."
I hope everyone will watch and share this @MSNBC interview. I promised I would tell the stories of these courageous women who have been horrifically mistreated by our government. They are still behind bars and I told them we would fight tirelessly for their release.

Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, is the richest person in the world) used its enormous power to kill a modest tax designed to address the affordable housing crisis in Seattle.

It's a simple question:  Should we listen to the majority of the American people who say they oppose spending more money on the military or should we listen to the lobbyists from the military industrial complex?

"For whatever reason—you got me, I don't know why—Trump and his administration want to make a bad situation even worse when it comes to health care in this country. "
President Trump's effusive remarks about Kim Jong Un are just the latest example of his very troubling affinity for authoritarians. 
The U.S. must stop its unconstitutional and unauthorized participation in this war and support the UN’s effort to get a cease-fire. No child should have to live like this. 
"This is America, a nation of compassion and generosity. We will not allow Trump, Sessions or anyone else to continue a policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers. Together, we will defeat this inhumane and un-American action."

The United States of America is not and must never be about locking up little children in cages on the southern border. 
We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and health care. It’s about time we got our national priorities right. That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today.
"What is happening at the border right now constitutes torture, according to @amnesty. Separating parents from their children is inhumane and must be stopped. "
"""We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view."" – @RepCummings "
"Since 1990, 4 defense contractors (including Lockheed &amp; Boeing) spent over $714 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. Yesterday, their wish for endless war was granted while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep on the street. "
"The Acting Director of ICE can't bring himself to say that separating families is humane, yet he insists on continuing this horrifying policy. "
"To be politically successful, Trump needs to create enemies and divide us up. He needs to turn men against women, white against black, straight against the LGBT community, Christian against Muslim, native born against immigrant. We will not let him win."
"When you have the most powerful nation on earth saying that it is acceptable to tear children from the arms of their parents, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities. That is a very dangerous signal."
Fact check: The Trump administration cannot keep their own story straight about the abhorrent practice of separating families at the border. Here is the truth about what's happening. 
"Trump’s executive order merely replaces one inhumane act with another. In response to the overwhelming public outrage at his policy of tearing children away from their parents at the border, this administration thinks the appropriate response is to indefinitely detain families. "
"I am hopeful that, as we have seen with other racist and xenophobic Trump policies, the courts will step in to rein in these unlawful actions."
"Because the American people spoke up, Trump has changed his policy of tearing children away from their parents and locking them up in detention cages. But the executive order that he issued today goes nowhere near as far as it should go. "
"Trump thinks he can win votes by showing how tough he is on these little children being separated at the border. Well, that's pretty pathetic and his policies must be defeated. "
Sen. Bernie Sanders said President Trump's zero tolerance immigration policy shows Trump is thinking like an authoritarian who believes his anti-immigrant policies will help him win votes  
"Trump's political strategy:
1) Give tax breaks to billionaires, throw millions off health insurance, cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid
2) Blame immigrants (or blacks, Muslims, gays, Jews) as the cause of all problems

This is the kind of hate politics demagogues always use"
"Trump's executive order does nothing to ensure the 2,400 kids who have been torn from their parents will be reunited with their families. "
"As it happens, I personally believe that it is totally appropriate for the UN to focus on poverty in the United States – the richest county in the history of the world. "
See my interview with @LyndaKinkade on @cnni today about the US leaving the Human Rights Council and my report on poverty &amp; human rights in the United States here #USApoverty: 
"Six months after Trump and Republicans in Congress passed their tax plan, they are still lying about who it really helps. Here is what's really going on as a result of their scam: "
The United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices. It's time to put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end. 
"Trump's strategy of hateful rhetoric and trying to divide the American people up is nothing new. It has been used by authoritarian leaders all over the world. Our job is stand together, fight back, and create the kind of country that we all know we can become. "

"Right now we must strengthen the global coalition of progressive democrats. While authoritarians promote division and hatred, we will promote unity, inclusion, and an agenda based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice. "
"What a hypocrite! @realDonaldTrump makes hateful and racist rants every day about how immigrants are “bad” for the country, but he had no problem hiring undocumented immigrants to help him build the Trump Hotel in DC or Trump Tower in New York City."
"Trump tells us every day how much he hates immigrants and how much he loves American workers. But last year, Trump chose to hire only one American worker even though thousands of Americans wanted to work at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The rest were low-wage temporary guest workers."

"To fight today’s extreme inequality, we must strengthen the coalition of progressive democrats and challenge the global oligarchy. - @SenSanders in @thenation "
.@RepJayapal visited a federal prison and met with asylum seekers who had been transferred from the border. What they told her is horrifying. We need to fight back against Trump's cruel immigration policy. 
"Never forget that corporations and their executives profit off of the Trump administration's inhumane immigration policies, along with our system of mass incarceration which locks up 2.2 million people in this country. "
Fox News' coverage of last week's horrific situation of children being separated from their parents at the border was a disgrace. 
"America loses when we become divided by religion, race, national origin or sexual orientation. We are stronger when we come together."
"The Supreme Court sided with fear, racism and xenophobia and against the American ideals of religious freedom and tolerance. Trump's travel ban isn't about keeping America safe. Just look at Trump’s own words. It's always been a racist attempt to ban Muslims from entering the US. "
Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected. 
Rep. @PeterWelch visited a border patrol “processing facility” in Texas holding hundreds of children. Here is what he saw. 
The Trump administration’s travel ban was never about keeping America safe. We need only look at Trump’s own words to understand that this has always been a racist and anti-Islamic attempt to ban Muslims from entering this country. 
"What the Kochs and other billionaires understand is that if they can destroy the trade union movement in America, it will be even more difficult for workers to earn decent wages and benefits, and the political power of working people will be diminished."
"To nobody’s surprise the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, sided with big money interests and against the needs of working people. Make no mistake about it: this decision is a direct assault on working families all over America. "
"While today’s ruling is a major setback for working families, we must redouble our efforts to make it easier, not harder, to join a union. We cannot rebuild the disappearing middle class without revitalizing the trade union movement."
"I completely agree with @SenSanders. Interpretations of “us vs them” are unproductive in our discourse and, in my opinion, misguided.

This is about fierce advocacy for working class Americans. "
"I joined @SenSanders in sending this letter to @Disney because no one who works for ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" should wonder where their next meal is coming from, or where they’re going to sleep at night. Every employer must pay their workers fair wages "
"The reality is that for many large corporations, wage theft has been an essential part of their business model. That has to change. "
"We should listen to what Sen. McConnell said in 2016. President Trump should not nominate, and the Senate should not confirm, a Supreme Court justice until the American people have had the opportunity to make their voices heard in November. "
"When it comes time to decide on a replacement for Justice Kennedy, I hope that my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their bodies will stand with those of us who oppose any nominee who would deny women the right to choose."
"I am excited to announce that on July 16 we will hold a live streamed town hall with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald’s and Walmart. I hope their CEOs will have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees.  "
Sen. Bernie Sanders is hosting a town hall for workers. Their CEOs are invited

"Our thoughts today are with the victims of the horrific shooting at the Capital Gazette yesterday, their families and their colleagues. "
There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work.
"""This is flirting with fascism in the open, in broad daylight now."" –@SanhoTree of Institute for Policy Studies on Trump's demonization of immigrants. "
Thank you to the thousands of people turning out today to protest Trump's cruel policy of separating families. The United States of America must never be about tearing apart families or locking up children in cages. #FamiliesBelongTogether
"No parent should have to worry about outrageous medical bills while their child is sick. We must pass Medicare for all so that health care is a right for all people in America, not a privilege for a few who can afford it. "
It's time to reduce the heavy burden of student debt that is weighing down the lives of millions of former college students and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. 
Have you worked a minimum wage fast food job? What is it like to try to support yourself or your family? Do you have access to benefits or career opportunities?
"We cannot risk a Supreme Court that would put in jeopardy a woman's right to control her own body.

Our job: mobilize Americans to demand the Senate must not vote on any potential Supreme Court justice until people have had a chance to make their voices heard in November. "
"We must not be about forcing over 10 million undocumented people, many of whom have been here for decades, to continue living in fear and anxiety. Congress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system."
"That will mean restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE. We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. We must not be about deporting DREAMers, young people who have lived in this country virtually their entire lives."
"In 2002 I voted against the creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. Now, it is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform."
".@realDonaldTrump, climate change is real, very real—and it is devastating our planet. Stop protecting the interests and short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry, and start worrying about the world future generations will inherit. "
"The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system by moving aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. When we do that, we protect the planet, create jobs and save consumers money."
"Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction. "
I will do everything possible to see that the next EPA administrator actually believes in environmental protection.
"Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, Pruitt has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country. His resignation is a positive step forward for our country."
"""I think this guy has done incalculable harm to environmental protection in this country, and he is also ethically challenged,"" says @SenSanders on Scott Pruitt, adding ""I'm delighted that he's gone""  "
"Ed Schultz was a passionate defender of American workers and strongly supported trade policies that work for all, not just large corporations. For many years his voice has been strong, steady &amp; against forces of corporate greed. Ed was a friend of mine and will be sorely missed."
"The bottom line is: health care is a right, not a privilege. People should not be forced to live in pain or avoid medical treatment because they lack the funds. We need Medicare for all, and we need it now. "
"Let your friends, family and co-workers know. If Trump nominates a right-wing reactionary to the Supreme Court, as is widely expected, we must mobilize the American people to defeat that nomination. "
The Trump administration's slavish devotion to corporate profits and their contempt for the health and well-being of Americans and people throughout the world is beyond appalling. 
Listen to these Patriotic Millionaires: it's patriotic for the very wealthy and corporations to want to pay their fair share in taxes. with @PatrioticMills 
"If you are serious about this issue, tell your Republican pals in Congress to pass bills requiring Medicare to negotiate drug prices and enabling the importation of safe, low-cost drugs from Canada and other countries. (2/2)"
"Stop just talking about high drug prices @realDonaldTrump. Do something. It's not just Pfizer that can raise drug prices ""for no reason."" It's every drug company. In case you didn't know, that's why we have the highest prescription drug prices in the world. (1/2) "
"If Trump appoints another right-wing extremist to the Supreme Court, I have very serious concerns about justice in this country, and what will happen to the people and future of our nation. "
"Bernie responds to Trump’s Supreme Court pick. Leave your questions for him in the comments:
"
"President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber-stamp for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump’s right-wing, reactionary nominee."

How would Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee rule on Roe v. Wade? Let candidate Donald Trump give you a hint. 
"We spend $700 billion on defense, more than the next 10 nations combined, and end up with 30 million uninsured and crumbling infrastructure.

Mr. President, instead of demanding that Europe spend more on planes and guns, why don’t we join them in guaranteeing health care to all. "
If Jeff Bezos is so proud of the working conditions at Amazon he should face his own employees at our town hall on Monday.  
"Over and over again, Donald Trump tells us the U.S. economy is “absolutely booming.” Then why have wages gone down, not up, by 5 cents an hour since June of last year after adjusting for inflation?"
"Extraordinary reporting by @JaneFerguson5, showing us pictures of the Yemen devastation that the Saudi coalition would rather we didn’t see. The US must stop supporting this catastrophic war. We cannot say we did not know. "

"This former Amazon manager suffered a mini-stroke after working continuous 16-hour days, sometimes without days off for two weeks at a time. This should not be happening in the richest country in the history of the world. "
"The Trump administration declaring the war on poverty “largely over"" is a callous attempt to justify their efforts to make massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security disability, education and affordable housing, while they give huge tax breaks to billionaires."
"The billionaires in the Trump administration should tell that to the:
- 140 million Americans struggling to pay for basic living expenses
- The more than 30 million people who have no health insurance
- The seniors trying to live on Social Security benefits of $12,000 a year. "
"I'd like McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook to explain why the company had enough money to reward its wealthy shareholders with $7.7 billion in stock buybacks, but reneged on a commitment it made to its low-wage workers to pay them at least $1-an-hour above the local minimum wage."
.@SteveEasterbrk I hope you will come to our town hall on Monday to explain why it's acceptable that you receive a huge compensation package while McDonald's workers struggle to put food on the table. The invitation to our town hall is sincere: 
"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion each and every year. That's absurd."
More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the “happiest place on Earth” to me. 
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. That is insane. 
"Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon made about $11,000/hour in compensation last year. I'd like to hear from him why he thinks his workers don't deserve to be paid a living wage of $15/hour."
"Universal health care in America is not a radical idea anymore, thanks to the millions who have spoken out to demand a just health care system. 63% of American voters now support a Medicare-for-all health care system."
"Last year American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits. Its CEO Doug Parker is on track to make $31 million this year.

They need to explain why 27% of workers at their subsidiary Envoy Air said they must accept food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet."
I hope American Airlines CEO Doug Parker will come to our town hall tomorrow at 7 PM ET to explain why it's acceptable that he receives a huge compensation package while his employees struggle to afford food:  
"How does it happen that there are major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps to survive?

That is what we will discuss tonight. "

Yesterday was a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. But it was a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in. 
"What world is Trump living in? Does he not understand what's going on? Is he being blackmailed because the Russians have compromising information on him? Or is he sympathetic to Putin's style of authoritarianism?

Congress must step in and stop Russian meddling in our elections. "
3) The Congress must demand that the sanctions against Russia that were passed last year be fully implemented.
"2) The Congress must move aggressively to protect our election systems from interference by Russia or any foreign power, and work closely with our democratic partners around the world to do the same."
1) The Congress must make it clear that we accept the assessment of our intelligence community with regard to Russian election meddling in our country and in other democracies.
"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now.

Congress must take these 5 actions to rein in Trump's dangerous behavior:"
"5) And finally, the Congress must make it clear to President Trump that his job is to protect the values that millions of Americans struggled, fought and died to defend: democracy, justice and equality."
"4) The Congress must make it clear that we will not accept any interference with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Mueller, such as the offer of preemptive pardons or the firing of Rod Rosenstein, and that the president must cooperate with this investigation."

American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year. Their workers should not have to rely on public assistance programs like food stamps and Medicaid to try to get by. 
How does it happen that companies which are owned by some of the wealthiest people in this country have workers not making enough money to feed their families and live in dignity? That is an issue the mainstream media has got to address.

"Looks like that $4,000 pay raise Trump promised working people from his tax cuts was just another lie he told to help enrich profitable corporations and billionaires. "
Thank you to the young people standing up to fossil fuel corporations and leading the movement to combat climate change. #ThisIsZeroHour 
"Before Roe v. Wade an estimated 200,000 - 1.2 million illegal abortions took place in the US every year. We cannot return to the days of back-room abortions, when countless women died or were maimed. "
"Please remember that our ideas, including Medicare for all, are not radical. They are what the vast majority of the American people want. "
"If he is confirmed, Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber stamp on the Supreme Court for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must do everything we can to see that he is defeated. "
"Brett Kavanaugh strongly believes the president should have more power. He has written that a president should be able to ""deem"" laws unconstitutional and not enforce them. Are those really the views we want on the Supreme Court under a Trump presidency? "
It is incomprehensible to me that we have a president who gave massive tax breaks to billionaires but wants to cut the WIC nutrition program for low-income pregnant women and their babies. 
Bernie Sanders Goes After The Cash-Bail System 
"Poverty is not a crime and hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, shouldn't be in jail because they can't afford cash bail. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and must be ended. "
"Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have not been convicted of a crime but are incarcerated because they cannot afford bail. Today, we are introducing legislation to end that disgrace. "
"“When you take away our rights in the workplace, our rights to bargain for better wages and a better life, you are no friend to us.” -@SenSanders #RedforFeds #1u #UnionStrong "
"Thank you @SenSanders for joining our fight to end cash bail! Proud to have introduced H.R. 1437, the No Money Bail Act because America should not be a country where freedom is based on income. More on H.R. 1437 here:  "
"Puerto Rico is trying to rebuild after Hurricane Maria, but it's being crushed by debt. @SenSanders &amp; I have a new bill to give territories that have suffered a major crisis a route to comprehensive debt relief and a chance to get back on their feet. "
Greedy Wall Street vulture funds must not be allowed to reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the Puerto Rican people for a second longer. 
"Thank you @SenSanders for introducing important legislation in an effort to #EndMoneyBail. For too long, the corporations that reap massive profits from this unjust destruction of our communities have been allowed to operate unchecked. This is an important step "

It's extremely concerning that the person charged with administering Medicare would rather throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance than join every major nation and guarantee health care as a fundamental right. 
I met with some of Vermont's smart and talented young people - students participating in the @ALBoysNation and @ALAforVeterans Girls Nation. Looking forward to great things from these student leaders. 
"I can't believe we have to say this in the year 2018: Poverty is not a crime.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail because they can't afford their bail."
Great to meet today with a @CarterCenter delegation of brave human rights defenders from around the world. 
Amazon just announced that they made $2.5 billion in profits last quarter. Why does Jeff Bezos still refuse to treat his workers with respect and dignity? 
"More than 65% of the people in county or city jails on any given day in 2016 had not been convicted of a crime, often because they lack the money to pay bail.

In other words, we have criminalized poverty. "
Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disneyland for their wonderful victory. They are an inspiration to low-wage workers all over this country who are struggling for justice and dignity. 
"What a hypocrite! Given the choice between hiring American workers at a living wage or hiring much less expensive workers from China that he can exploit, Donald Trump opts for the low-wage overseas labor day in and day out. "
"Bail has criminalized poverty and undermined the tenet of 'innocent before proven guilty,' writes @SenSanders.

We must reform a broken system that punishes Americans for crimes even if they're never convicted: "
"""Do you know what it's like to not have food for your children?"" Listen to these two single mothers tell their stories about struggling every day just to survive in this economy. "
"In a country in which we pride ourselves on the principle of “innocent until proven guilty” we should not be keeping hundreds of thousands of people locked up before they have actually been convicted of a crime, says @SenSanders "
"-40 million Americans still live in poverty
-30 million have no health insurance
-Half of older workers have no retirement savings

And what does Trump's tax plan accomplish? Make the very, very rich much richer. What a disgrace. "
If Roe v. Wade is overturned it will have an immediate impact on millions of women’s lives around the country. States are already trying to come as close to banning abortion as they possibly can. 
"Even a Koch brothers-funded attempt to trash Medicare for All can't hide the truth: Medicare for All will lead to a $2 TRILLION REDUCTION in national health expenditures over 10 years.

That’s trillion with a “T.”
"
Here are all the ways Trump has failed working families: 
"Let’s talk for a minute about this study from libertarian think tank Mercatus Center. AP headline: ""‘Medicare for All’ Would Cost $32.6 Trillion Over 10 Years, Study Says""

While sorta true, this misses that Mercatus is projecting M4A would actually *save billions of dollars* "
"On Medicare's 53rd birthday, there are two competing visions for the system's future - destroy it, or expand it to cover everyone:  #MedicareForAll"
"For a company like Amazon which holds an unbelievable amount of wealth and power to treat its workers this way is simply unconscionable. This is the kind of corporate greed that is destroying the social fabric of our country.
"
Cynthia Murray has worked at Walmart for 18 years and still doesn’t make $15 an hour. That is a disgrace. 
That study going around on Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan comes with a big catch — the US would actually be saving money overall on healthcare 
This is the reality of what it's like to work for Amazon. 
"Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All! "
"If every major country on Earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita, please don't tell me that the United States cannot do the same."
How a libertarian analyst inadvertently made a good case for Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All 
We took some American doctors to Canada to see a universal health care system up close. Here's what they learned: 
Here's what happened when a Republican senator challenged a Canadian doctor on their single-payer health care system. 
"""To anybody who thinks it’s fine to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions, you need to know that without insurance, I would probably die."" Liz Leavens is one of many people afraid of what might happen if Republicans get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions. "
"At a time when gun violence and school shootings are becoming more and more routine, the last thing we need is to enable anyone – including people who otherwise couldn’t legally purchase a gun – to ‘print’ a gun on a 3-D printer. "
Fox News is at it again. They can't accept what a right-wing think tank found: that Medicare for All will actually save our country trillions of dollars. 
"If Norway, along with every other major country on Earth, can make health care a right, why can't the United States do the same? "
How does a universal health care system actually work? Hear it from Canadian doctors who have seen it firsthand. 
"Americans are sick and tired of our wasteful, inefficient, dysfunctional health care system. They want Medicare for all. "
"What insurance company CEOs made in 2017:
-Leonard Schleifer (Regeneron): $95.3 million
-Dave Wichmann (UnitedHealth): $83.2 million
-Mark Bertolini (Aetna): $58.7 million

We need a system that provides health care for all, not massive compensation for a few CEOs.#MedicareForAll"
"Even with private health insurance, Kim Leighton is still paying thousands of dollars for life-saving health care. Our system is broken. We need Medicare for all. "
Fox News wants you to believe that Medicare for All will limit your intake of donuts. Here's why they're wrong: 
"No matter what Fox News comes up with to try to discredit Medicare for all, a majority of the American people have made it clear time and time again that we should join every other major country and make health care a right. "
"A cancer patient should be able to focus all their time and energy on their road to recovery. Instead, this single mom had to worry about $160,000 in medical bills. We need #MedicareForAll. "

"Trump promised a nation of ""law and order"" and to be ""tough on crime."" So why is he letting corporate criminals off the hook? "
"While Jeff Bezos spends $12 million renovating his 5th mansion, this Amazon employee is forced to live out of her car. "
Trump claimed that you need a photo ID to buy groceries. What he's actually doing is making the case for voter suppression. 
"Bernie Sanders is leading the charge to reform cash bail. Maybe it’s time to retire the myth that he prioritizes economic justice over criminal justice reform, write Meagan Day and @sunraysunray. "
"We cannot continue to have a ""debtor prison"" system in the United States. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and it must be ended. "
"Despite Trump’s tax giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, real wages have actually gone down, not up, since June 2017. The economy may be the best in history for billionaires like Jeff Bezos, but it is not ""booming"" for the average worker."
"Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. "
"This is an outrageous move. It's entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments. We must continue to do so. The US must be clear in condemning repression, especially when done by governments that receive our support. "
"Trump makes racist attacks on LeBron James, as well as many other black athletes, to feel powerful and divide us up. Congratulations to LeBron on opening the I Promise school—setting a great example for the young people of our country, unlike the president."

"It's never been more clear who the Trump Administration is really working for.
"
"The U.S. has a president who is so ""tough"" that he can order tiny kids to be torn from their parents' arms. Unfortunately, he's not so tough that he can speak out on human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a leader who sounded more like @JustinTrudeau. "
"By backing the Saudi coalition’s war in Yemen with weapons, aerial refueling, and targeting assistance, the United States is complicit in this atrocity. No one can seriously claim that our support for this war is actually making us safer. "
Here's how Trump's world of fiction is undermining our democracy and how we can fight back: 
"Maybe, just maybe, we should make sure our people are not dying because they lack health insurance before we start spending billions to militarize outer space. #SpaceForce"
Medicare for all would save both dollars and lives compared to our current profit-driven system. It’s time to join every other major country and guarantee health care for all.  
"A year ago, countless people were injured protesting white supremacy and Neo-Naziism in Charlottesville and and one person, Heather Heyer, was killed. Today, we honor Heather, and all who stood up to hate, by recommitting ourselves to fighting all forms of racism and bigotry."
"No, Secretary Zinke. The record-breaking wildfires in California have everything to do with climate change. We must confront the reality that climate change is already destroying tens of thousands of lives, and take concrete steps to avoid its worst consequences. "
Enough is enough! No one in America should go deeply in debt or bankrupt for the crime of getting an education. It is time to reduce the burden of student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition free.

"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for all, single-payer program. "
"A year. It took nearly a year to restore power in Puerto Rico after the devastation of Hurricane Maria.

The way the Trump administration has handled this crisis is an international disgrace.

I think there is a growing understanding that there is something fundamentally wrong when three people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of the country. 
"'If every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the US cannot do the same.' @SenSanders "

What Trump and his friends in the fossil fuel industry are doing is criminal. 
The cost of college has increased astronomically in just one generation. This isn't sustainable. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. 
"This is how our rigged system works:

1) Republicans give huge tax breaks to their wealthy campaign contributors

2) Billionaires spend millions to elect Republicans

3) Republicans push cuts to Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer"
"Our job: Overturn Citizens United, move to the public funding of elections and create an economy and political system that works for all of us, not just the top 1 percent. "
"This must not go unnoticed. The Trump administration just announced their extremely dangerous plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump: You are threatening not only this generation, but you're threatening the lives of our children and grandchildren.
"
"The good news is, the ideas that we have been talking about—Medicare for all, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, leaving a healthy planet for our kids and grandkids—are now mainstream ideas supported by the vast majority of the American people. "
McDonald's just announced it is spending $6 billion on makeovers of its restaurants while still refusing to pay its workers a living wage. 
1) We correctly state that the Mercatus report found that the American people would save $2 trillion over 10 years under Medicare for All. That finding is right here in Table 2 of the Mercatus study. 
"I thank @jaketapper for admitting his “fact check” on Medicare for All was not factual and editing his video.

Sadly, Tapper's video on Medicare for All along with other “fact checks” is riddled with errors peddled by the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Let's go through them: "
"2) Tapper says, “The study’s author says that that $2 trillion drop is not actually his conclusion. He says that’s based on assumptions by Senator Sanders.” Wrong. Provider payment rates in our plan are not assumptions, they are written into the bill..."
3) What Tapper and others have done is say we're wrong because Blahous didn't actually intend to find that Medicare for All would be a great deal for Americans. The problem is: Blahous did find it would save $2 trillion – he just doesn't like that people are celebrating it.
...Any score that replaces Medicare reimbursement rates with some other set of rates is not a score of our plan.
"5) @swoolhandler and @awgaffney have found that even though the Mercatus study “grossly underestimates the main sources of savings” from Medicare for All, the “central finding” from the study is that it saves Americans $2 trillion over a decade. "
4) This isn't just Bernie talking. @JeffDSachs found that Medicare for All could save Americans a lot more than the $2 trillion in the Mercatus Center report. 
"7) Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago said: ""Over the long run, the Sanders people are very correct that you could implement a system like this that would be more disciplined, more economical and more fair than the current U.S. health system."" "
6) @MattBruenig has found that payments to medical providers would only go down by 10.6% under Medicare for All (not 40%) which could be more than made up for by the administrative savings that would be achieved. 
"9) Ernie Tedeschi, a former economist at the Treasury Department has also pointed out that the Mercatus study shows that Medicare for All will reduce national health expenditures by $2 trillion over 10 years. "
"8) The founder of Medicare Rights Center says, ""Blahous concedes that Medicare for All would reduce national health spending by $2 trillion over 10 years, even after accounting for the cost of guaranteeing everyone coverage and offering better benefits."" "
"10) But instead of talking to any of these experts, the corporate fact checkers are blindly trusting the author of the Mercatus report even though his previous studies have been called “misleading,” “arbitrary,” “discredited,” “mighty odd” and “bogus.” "
"11) So, the question that must be asked is why would the corporate media would put their blind faith in a far right-wing economist whose past reports have been so thoroughly discredited by mainstream economists and experts?"
“We have the people...and we’re gonna WIN THIS FIGHT!” - U.S. Senator @SenSanders #APWUnited #FiredUp 
This teacher is one of many millions of Americans saddled with insurmountable student debt. It’s time to make college tuition free in America. 
"Our health care system isn't designed to provide quality, cost-effective care for all. It exists to make profits for insurance companies, drug companies and medical equipment suppliers. That must change. #MedicareForAll "
Here it is! A leading Republican just admitted that they plan to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for the massive tax cuts they gave billionaires and large corporations.  
Trump is actively destroying the planet in order to enrich his billionaire friends in the fossil fuel industry. We must fight back. 
"Imagine proposing a plan that you know will kill thousands of Americans every year.

That's exactly what Donald Trump's EPA just did. "
A Koch-funded think tank tries hard to pretend that it didn't find savings from Bernie Sanders' Medicare plan 
"President Trump's associates who have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of serious crimes – so far:

- His campaign chairman
- His deputy campaign chairman
- His lawyer
- His national security advisor
- His foreign policy advisors"
Americans deserve to know the truth about the 2016 election. Any attempt by the president to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation or pardon Cohen or Manafort would be a very serious offense.
"At a time when Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime, we shouldn’t confirm a Supreme Court justice picked by Trump, who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed. The Senate must postpone Kavanaugh’s hearings until the ongoing investigations are complete."
The Koch brothers-funded Mercatus Center might not like that their report revealed Medicare for all will save Americans $2 trillion. But numbers don't lie. 
"Betsy DeVos has a brilliant idea. While paltry school budgets deny kids a decent education, she may let states use federal funds to buy guns for educators—not books, computers or pay raises. Guns. Meanwhile the Trump administration opposes all commonsense gun safety legislation."
Incredible. According to a new poll 70 percent of Americans now support Medicare for all—including 52 percent of Republicans! The momentum is with us. 
"While Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased $260 million every single day this year, he continues to pay many Amazon employees wages so low that they're forced to depend on taxpayer-funded programs such as food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive. "
"There is something fundamentally wrong when thousands of Amazon workers are on food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world. "
"Instead of paying people to tweet positive things about his corporation, Jeff Bezos needs to get off welfare, improve working conditions at Amazon's warehouses and pay his workers a living wage. "

Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disney World for their historic victory. I applaud everyone who stood up to demand that workers at one of the wealthiest corporations in the world should have a decent standard of living. 
"Billionaires shouldn't be on welfare. If the owners of large, profitable corporations won't pay workers a living wage, then we are going to tax them for 100% of the public assistance benefits their workers are forced to rely on."
Those of us who believe in democracy must understand the scope of the challenge of authoritarianism if we are to effectively confront it. 
Are you a current or former Amazon employee? Please share your experiences with Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
We know our health care system is profoundly broken when a family has to file for bankrupcy for saving their newborn's life.

This is a catastrophic loss of American lives. The Trump administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been disturbingly inadequate. We must use the full resources of the United States government to help the island recover.

"The Trump administration recently said the War on Poverty is “largely over and a success.” Honestly, I do not know what world they are living in. "
"Bottom line: No one working for the wealthiest person on Earth should have to rely on food stamps. No one working for a man who earns $260 million a day should be forced to sleep in their car. Yet that is what's happening at Amazon.

My full response:  "
"Amazon is paying some of its employees to tweet positive stories about the company. Hmm, why is that? "
"Amazon’s warehouses are one of the most dangerous places to work in the U.S. According to the NCOSH, seven Amazon workers have died on or near the job since 2013. I will be asking OSHA to investigate unsafe working conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers."
"A question for Amazon: If you’re so proud of the way you treat your workers, why are you relying on so many temporary workers who receive low wages, unreliable schedules and no benefits? "
".@amazon, if our claims about wages and working conditions at Amazon are inaccurate then prove it.

Make public the number of people you hire through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and make public the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn. "
"Wow. @SenSanders is really getting under Amazon’s skin. This response on their corporate blog is a feat of corporate-speak — sort of hilarious and enraging all at once. Let’s break this down… 1/

"""I am fully convinced that the success of Amazon is actually created by the sheer terror of pushing people to the extreme."" - Werner Cox, former Amazon manager. "
"The median Amazon employee makes $13.67 an hour.

Many of those employees rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.

You know who pays for that? You do.

You know what Jeff Bezos makes every hour? $10,833,33

It's time for Amazon to get off corporate welfare."
"If Amazon is so proud of the way it treats its workers, why won’t it make public the number of people it hires through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn? "
"I said it in 1992 and not much seems to have changed. By and large, the Congress is owned by big money interests and the largest corporations in America. "

"What is the Trump administration trying to hide about Brett Kavanaugh? If Republicans believe he deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, they must stop hiding his records and release all of his documents."
"President Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime. We should not confirm his Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a man who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed."
Massive companies like Walmart and Amazon should not be able to pay their workers so little that American taxpayers have to subsidize their basic needs. I will be joining @SenSanders at 11am EST Wednesday 9/5 to announce legislation that will hold these companies accountable.
"Amazon is worth $1 TRILLION.

Jeff Bezos is worth $155 BILLION.

Thousands of Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.

That is what a rigged economy looks like. Tomorrow we will introduce a bill to end subsidies for low-wage employers. "
The public still doesn’t have 96% of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s documents. What are Republicans hiding? 
"If employers in this country simply paid workers a living wage, taxpayers would save about $150 billion a year on federal assistance programs and millions of workers would be able to live in dignity and security."
"It's time to get Jeff Bezos, the Waltons and other billionaires who won't pay a living wage off of welfare. Today I'm introducing legislation to give them a choice: pay workers a living wage, or pay for the public assistance your low-wage workers rely on.
"
Let's be clear: the government has a moral responsibility to provide for the vulnerable. But taxpayers should not have to expend huge sums of money subsidizing profitable corporations owned by some of the wealthiest people in the country and the world.

Social Security matters. 
Mr. Pompeo: human lives are worth far more than defense contractor profits. We must end America's involvement in this disastrous and unconstitutional war. The Senate must also investigate this effort to mislead us.

PhRMA lobbying to increase the price of life-saving prescription drugs for seniors in a bill to help address the opioid epidemic is a perfect example of what is wrong with Washington D.C.

Congratulations to Seattle for clearing past misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession that were prosecuted before marijuana was legalized. We must decriminalize marijuana nationally and expunge federal marijuana use and possession crimes.

Trump and Judge Kavanaugh have two options. Trump can withdraw Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Or Kavanaugh himself can call for an FBI investigation if he truly believes the allegations are false.
"If President Trump is afraid of what an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will confirm or uncover, then the nomination should be withdrawn. "
"Independent @SenSanders calls President Trump an “unstable guy who lies a whole lot.”

“Whatever he says today may change tomorrow.”  "
"Today we need to remember: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the others who have come forward have done so with incredible courage, fully knowing that their character would be attacked and terrible things said about them. Their lives will never be the same. We owe them our respect."
We should not be attacking and disparaging the women who have come forward with serious allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Trump's comments are disgusting. 
"Senator Dick Durbin: ""With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?""

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford: ""100 percent."" "

"I listened to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I believe Dr. Ford.

Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court.

If Judge Kavanaugh wants to clear his name of these serious charges he should demand an FBI investigation. If not, the Senate must reject his nomination."
A man who uses the same hostile and aggressive tactics as Donald Trump when faced with credible allegations of sexual assault does not deserve a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
Brett Kavanaugh lied repeatedly to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He does not belong on the Supreme Court. 
"""This Judiciary Committee is no longer an independent, equal branch of government. We're no longer that. We're an arm, and a very weak arm, of the Trump White House."" –@SenatorLeahy "
"Lying to Congress is a federal crime.

"If @ChuckGrassley and Senate Republicans are concerned a thorough FBI investigation would delay this confirmation process, remember that you refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garland’s nomination for nearly a year."
"The FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh must include a review of his numerous untruthful statements in his previous testimony before Congress. Lying to Congress is a federal crime.

Here are his statements that appear to not be true: (1/x)"
In 2004 Judge Kavanaugh testified the nomination of William Pryor to the 11th Circuit “was not one that I worked on personally.” Documents now contradict that statement. (4/x)
In 2006 Kavanaugh told Congress he didn't know anything about the NSA warrantless wiretapping program prior to it being reported by the NYT. This year an email revealed that while at the White House he might have been involved in some conversations about this program. (3/x)
Kavanaugh was asked more than 100 times if he knew about files stolen by Republican staffers from Judiciary Committee Democrats. He said he knew nothing. Newly released emails show that these files were regularly shared with Kavanaugh while he was on the WH staff. (2/x)
"Kavanaugh repeatedly told the committee he never drank to the point where he didn’t remember something. He also denied ever becoming aggressive when he drinks. There have been many reports from Kavanaugh's high school, college and law school classmates that contradict this. (7/x)"
"Kavanaugh testified before the committee that he did not believe polygraphs were reliable. In 2016 he wrote, “The Government has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes.” What changed his opinion or was he misleading the committee? (6/x)"
"In 2006 Judge Kavanaugh testified, “I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.” New evidence released as part of these confirmation hearing contradicts that assertion. (5/x)"
"Kavanaugh claimed he didn't drink on weeknights but an entry on his calendar for Thursday July 1 states, “Go to Timmy’s for Skis w/ Judge, Tom, Pj, Bernie, Squi.” Kavanaugh clarified to Sen. Booker that “Skis” referred to beer. Was Kavanaugh's original statement truthful? (10/10) "
"Kavanaugh claimed that he and Dr. Ford “did not travel in the same social circles.” Dr. Ford said she dated Chris Garrett, referenced as a friend in his yearbook. In fact she testified Garrett introduced her to Kavanaugh. (9/x)"
Judge Kavanaugh testified he treated women “as friends and equals” and “with dignity and respect.” Numerous entries in his school yearbook would seem to contradict this. Was Judge Kavanaugh’s statement to the committee truthful? (8/x)

Fox News heard out an alleged alien abductee after spending a week doubting Christine Blasy Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. 
Trump and Ted Cruz love to say that they’ll protect Americans with pre-exisiting conditions. So why do they keep pushing policies that do the opposite? 
"After a SeaWorld trainer was drowned by a killer whale in 2010, Judge Kavanaugh said the company should be immune from penalty. "
".@AdyBarkan has been battling terminal ALS, but he's been spending the last year to educate the public on why health care should be a right. He is a true American hero. "
"While the country has been fixated on the Kavanaugh nomination, House Republicans just passed another tax cut windfall for the wealthy, as if their $2 trillion giveaway last year wasn't enough. Shameful.
"
"No, Mr. President. Dr. Ford's allegations are not a ""con job."" We believe her. Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court. "
One year ago 58 people were killed and 800 injured by a gunman in Las Vegas. My thoughts are with those victims' families today. We have got to prevent more innocent Americans from becoming victims of gun violence by passing commonsense gun safety legislation.
"If Brett Kavanaugh knew about Deborah Ramirez's allegation of sexual assault before the publication of the Sept. 23 New Yorker story, then he lied to Congress. That's a federal crime. "

"What Mr. Bezos has done today is not only enormously important for Amazon’s hundreds of thousands of employees, it could well be a shot heard around the world. I urge corporate leaders around the country to follow Mr. Bezos' lead. "
"This is what the political revolution is all about: today 350,000 Amazon workers found out they are getting a raise to at least $15 an hour. "
.@BernieSanders &amp; I introduced the Bezos Act a month ago asking billion dollar companies to pay for their employees’ public benefits. We urged Mr. Bezos to raise wages to $15. The beltway economists crucified us. But Mr. Bezos listened. Today thousands of workers are better off. 
"Today is a great victory for workers at Amazon and the #FightFor15. Although the establishment did not take @SenSanders and I seriously with this initiative, I am glad that @JeffBezos and Amazon did and gave their workers the raise they deserve. "
What happened at Amazon is a big step forward for workers across the nation. I want to thank the many hundreds of workers at Amazon fulfillment centers all across this country who contacted us and spoke up.

Dr. Ford has received death threats. Nazis have protested outside her house. Last week, she was forced to publicly answer questions about an experience so painful it still haunts her.

Let me say this to all the survivors out there: I hear you. I believe you. Thank you for speaking out.
"McDonald's made $5.1 billion in profits last year and rewarded wealthy shareholders with over $7.7 billion.

Meanwhile, many McDonald's workers need food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.

That is unacceptable. McDonald's workers need $15 and a union. "
"If Amazon and Disney can pay $15 an hour, so can McDonald's, which made $5.1 billion in profits last year.

"Trump doesn't believe that universal health care works anywhere in the world. He should listen to what he said about Canada, Scotland and Australia. Every other major country on earth does it. Stop lying Mr. President. "
"4 Republican policies led to a $779 billion deficit in 2018:

- Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B
- Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B
- Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B
- Defense increases since 9/11: $156 B

Without tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS."
"Save this tweet, folks, so you have it ready next time a Republican tells you we have to slash health care, Social Security, and education because of the deficit. "
"If your plan to get elected is to suppress as many minority voters, young voters, and voters with disabilities as possible, it's pretty clear you shouldn't be in politics in the first place."
"Here’s what’s crazy: throwing 32 million Americans off health insurance and cutting Medicare by $500 billion.

That’s Trump’s plan.

We have a better idea: Improve Medicare for seniors by providing dental, vision and hearing aids – and expand it to guarantee health care for all. "
"Of the many issues with Trump, his movement to an authoritarian type society here in American and his support for authoritarians around the world should be of concern to every American who believes in democracy."
"Mitch McConnell wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to pay for Republicans' massive giveaway to the rich and large corporations.

Enough!

The American people must stand up and make clear to McConnell that we will expand, not cut, programs working people rely on. "
"Another pipeline exploded, this time in British Columbia. And yet another community is now in danger. We must imediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. "
"Trump's top economic advisor just dismissed a devastating climate change report from the United Nations. What Trump, his administration and his fossil fuel executive friends are doing to the planet is criminal. "
"While other states are making it harder to vote, I’m proud that Vermont is leading the nation by making it easier to participate in the political process. If we believe in a vibrant democracy, we need to have the highest voter turnout in the world. "
"Translation: Gut Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security "
"Did you know we once had a Republican president who expanded Social Security? Maybe today's Republicans should listen to what he had to say about the program, instead of trying to destroy it. "
"Shameful.
"
I have long been troubled by the nature of the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. It's time for us to thoroughly reevaluate that relationship. 
The president makes it more and more clear with every authoritarian he meets that he not only admires them but wants to follow their lead. 
"The crisis we face as a country is not because of voter fraud. It is because of voter suppression. If Republicans must intimidate and disenfranchise voters in order to win, then they should not be running for office in the first place.
"
The debate over climate change in Washington really has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do with campaign contributions. 
"We cannot have an ally who murders a dissident in cold blood, in their own consulate. That is unacceptable by any government, but especially by one so closely aligned with the United States."
"By attacking the media and condoning violent behavior toward journalists, Trump is giving a green light to authoritarians all over the world to endanger the lives of those who work for a free press."
"The Sears bankruptcy is yet another example that our economy is rigged for a powerful few at the top. Vulture capitalists have hollowed out a company to line their own pockets. It's time to build an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%. "
Too many Americans have fought and died to defend democracy. We cannot have a president who applauds a murdering despot as a ‘strong person’ who ‘truly loves his country.’ 
Ending support for the Saudi war in Yemen is exactly what my colleagues and I tried to do earlier this year with SJ Res 54. Next month we will bring it back to the floor for another vote. 
"By now, we all know what Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman's regime is capable of. It's time for action. Congress must cut military aid to this brutal monarchy and end the cruel, pointless war in Yemen.

"The news about bombing attempts against President Obama, Secretary Clinton, George Soros, CNN, various Democratic officials and others is gravely disturbing. While many more details will come to light, these deeply un-American acts of violence have no place in our democracy."
"In this country we battle with words and ideas, not fists and bombs.

Acts of violence, appeals to violence and condoning violence have no place in American society."
"The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is part of an alarming trend with Saudi Arabia. The United States must stand for human rights everywhere, and make clear to the Saudis that this includes their country too.
"
"In far too many cases, @SenSanders writes, American-made bombs have targeted civilians in Yemen "
The brutal murder of Mr. Khashoggi demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional. 
"America’s students are $1.5 trillion in debt. We need stronger, bolder policies that protect our students from fraudulent loan providers. The College for All Act, my legislation with @SenSanders, would cut student loan interest rates by half.

"American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year, but many of its workers are forced to rely on food stamps to survive.

"A worker making the federal minimum wage needs to work 99 hours a week, 52 weeks a year just to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment

"Three people own more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans. This is what a rigged economy is all about and why we are fighting for a government and economy that works for ALL people, not just Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. "

"Donald Trump and his advisers believe in huge tax breaks for billionaires, but when it comes to raising wages for workers they actually want to abolish the minimum wage.

Too many Americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. "
"The Republican agenda is clear:

1) Take health care away from 32 million Americans
2) Give huge tax cuts to billionaires and large, profitable corporations
3) Slash Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security
4) Allow the planet to be destroyed"
"Donald Trump's top economic adviser wants to abolish the federal minimum wage.

We want to give a raise to 41 million Americans by increasing the federal minimum wage to a living wage – $15 an hour. "

"It’s good to see the Trump administration finally admit what some of us have been saying for a long time: the disastrous war in Yemen must end.

Next month the Senate will have the chance to show we are serious about ending US support for this war by voting on SJ Res 54. "
"Donald Trump and his advisor think the federal minimum wage is ""a terrible idea."" Wrong. We need to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. "
"The Republican agenda is clear.

Our plan: make health care a right to all. Stop giving tax breaks to billionaires. Protect and expand Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Transition to sustainable energy and leave behind a livable planet for our children. "
President Trump must allow Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation to continue unimpeded. Any attempt by the president or the Justice Department to interfere with Mueller’s probe would be an obstruction of justice and impeachable offense. 
"Congress must pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, demand that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the probe based on his previous statements and only confirm a new attorney general who vows to protect Mueller's investigation."

"There is no magical or simple solution to the epidemic of gun violence in our country. The mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, tells us, however, that we must do everything possible to stop these never-ending tragedies."
"Further, at a time when too many Americans are harboring homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts, we must greatly improve access to mental health counseling."
"This is a positive step. US participation is unauthorized, unconstitutional and must end completely. I will soon bring SJ Res 54 back to the floor, so the Senate can end US participation in the Yemen war as a matter of law, not simply as a matter of the president’s discretion. "
In the first week of the new Congress I will be re-introducing my legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. We have got to end starvation wages in the richest country in the world.

The Senate is voting on whether to move forward with my resolution to end U.S. support for the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch here:

".@SenSanders, @SenMikeLee, @ChrisMurphyCT &amp; 60 of their colleagues made history by voting in support of #SJRes54 today.

It is now a matter of when, not if, the unconstitutional U.S.-Saudi war will end. The House must reject @SpeakerRyan's inaction and vote to end Yemen's misery."
"For the first time, the U.S. Senate just voted to advance a resolution withdrawing U.S. Armed Forces from an unauthorized and unconstitutional war.

Let us bring this catastrophic war in Yemen to an end, and help bring peace and humanitarian aid to this tortured country. "

“It’s inevitable that we’re going to create jobs...And we can use the transition to 100% renewable energy to achieve racial and economic justice in this country.” @Ocasio2018 with all the reasons why we need a #GreenNewDeal. This is our moonshot. #ClimateTownHall

"Some argue that the US is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But as these Yemeni human rights activists told me recently, when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it’s very clear that the US is part of this war. This must end. "
"Thank you to the many, many people who attended and watched our groundbreaking Solving Our Climate Crisis town hall last night, as well as our terrific panelists.

This was just the beginning of a movement to protect the planet and create millions of jobs. #ClimateTownHall "
"This Californian saw the effect of the disastrous wildfires firsthand. If we don't get our act together to boldly address climate change, this is going to be the new normal. "
"Georgetown isn’t the biggest or bluest city in Texas. But last year, it became the first one to convert to 100 percent renewable energy, as well as the largest U.S. city so far. Mayor Dale Ross spoke to @ptsarahdactyl after this week's #ClimateTownHall: "
"""We have a moral and ethical obligation to take care of those people that have made their life plans working in the coal mines. But ... everybody understands the coal industry is dying."" -- Dale Ross, mayor of Georgetown TX "
Antroinette's daughter Antavia died because she had to ration her insulin—something that should never happen again in the wealthiest country in the world. Pharma's greed is literally killing people in this country and they must be stopped. 
"12 million people in Yemen are suffering from severe hunger and 85,000 kids have already died from starvation as a result of the Saudi-led war.

The United States should not be supporting Saudi Arabia in this disastrous war. The U.S. Senate must vote to end our involvement."
Have your prescriptions shot up in price? Are you splitting pills in half to make your prescriptions last longer? Have you had to stop taking medicine altogether in order to pay other bills? Tell Bernie your story. 
It is really a disgrace that the major TV networks constantly ignore climate change or give climate deniers a platform. That is exactly why I brought together some of the greatest climate experts in the world to do what the mainstream media won't do. 
Walmart is the poster child of corporate greed in America today. We must demand that they pay a living wage. 
What's it like fleeing a wildfire? Listen to this nurse describe how she and her team narrowly escaped California's recent climate change-fueled disasters. 
This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue. 
"I look forward to an up-or-down vote next week to end U.S involvement in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am confident that we have the bipartisan votes to pass the War Powers resolution in the Senate, which would be an historic step forward."
"There is virtually unanimous agreement in Congress that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi must be addressed. I look forward to supporting my colleagues’ additional legislative proposals at the appropriate time, but right now I am focused on securing an up or down vote on S.J.Res. 54."
U.S. Senator of Vermont stops by the Ed Sullivan Theater tonight. Tune in to see @SenSanders! #LSSC 
"This report from Yemen states it clearly—U.S. tax dollars are being used to starve children in Yemen. Next week the Senate will vote on SJ Res 54, and tell the president and the world that the U.S. must no longer be complicit in this humanitarian disaster. "
"Sears wants to give its executives $25 million in bonuses after closing over 100 stores and laying off thousands of employees. My friends, this is what a rigged economy is all about. (with @riseupretail) "
People 65 and older must have pretty good health insurance 🤔 
Thankfully there is a way to make sure that nobody has to delay or cancel the care they need because they can't afford it. #MedicareForAll
The Amazon pay raise @SenSanders and I fought for is now helping workers outside of the company bargain for better wages and benefits. We will keep fighting for an economy where all workers are in a strong position to demand the living wages they were denied for decades. 
"The bad news: our president doesn't believe in science.

The good news: today 1,000 young people stood up to demand that Congress take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.

We're going to win this fight for our people and planet. "
"1 out of 5 Americans cannot afford the medication they need.

Pharmaceutical executives must be held accountable for the massive price-fixing scheme they have concocted to jack up the price of life-saving prescription drugs. "
Spread the word: Saturday is the last day of open enrollment to sign up for health insurance. Go to  to choose a plan and get covered. 
Tomorrow I'll move to proceed to the resolution I've offered with @SenMikeLee and @ChrisMurphyCT to end US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am optimistic that a bipartisan coalition will vote to make clear we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in its destructive war.
"Today the U.S. Senate will vote on whether to end US support for the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen.

This would be the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war.

We must finally end US involvement in this humanitarian and strategic disaster."
14 million people are on the brink of famine in Yemen. 85k children have already died from cholera and starvation. Our Yemen War Powers Resolution can’t wait until 2019. We must pass it now to save lives. 
"Here comes @SenSanders, starting off the Senate vote to get the US out of the Saudi-Emirati coalition devastating Yemen."
"The eyes of the world are watching the Senate today. Shortly, we will vote to end U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch my speech here:  "
"Let us show the world today that the U.S. Senate recognizes that real American power does not come from our ability to blow things up, but from our ability to bring people together.

We must finally end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen."

"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Trump's defense of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Trump is ""not a great fan of democracy. He likes authoritarian leaders all over the world, whether its Putin in Russia, MBS in Saudi Arabia or even the leader of North Korea""  "
"For the first time, the Senate will vote today on ending an unauthorized war.

14 million people in Yemen are on the brink of starvation. 85,000 kids have starved to death.

The U.S. must stop supporting this disastrous Saudi-led war.  "
The people of Denmark are some of the happiest on earth. I met with @DanJoergensen of Denmark's Social Democratic Party (@Spolitik) to learn why. 
This Fox News judge does a great job explaining why President Trump is in real trouble. 
"Everyone needs to see this to understand the consequences of today's Senate vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.

85,000 kids have starved to death.
14 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation.

The Senate must end our involvement in this humanitarian disaster. "
It is time for the United States Congress to tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we do not intend to follow their lead in their military adventurism. Speaking live now:  
BREAKING: Senate approves resolution calling for ending U.S. military involvement in Saudi Arabia-led military action in Yemen 
"Once in a while, with persistent prodding and shaming, the U.S. Senate rises to the moment.

Final vote on the Lee/Sanders/Murphy resolution to pull America out of the immoral, disastrous Yemen war: 56-41.

A historic day."
HISTORIC VICTORY: The Senate has voted to stop U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. This is the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war. 
"Bernie hails passage of Yemen resolution as a historic moment, one that allows ""the country see that their elected representatives are about to take back their constitutional responsibility on the issues of war"""
"Vote by vote, we are winning! The Senate just voted 56 to 41 to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen! #SJRES54 1/ "
"Thank you to all of you who have signed, called, and raised your voices to stop U.S. support for the war in #Yemen. We still have work to do, but this vote shows the power of the people to work for peace. 4/ "
"In a rebuke to Trump, the Senate votes to halt U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen  "
"This is a big deal. The Senate just approved my resolution with @SenSanders &amp; @SenMikeLee to end U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen. Here's why that matters, and what has to happen next. "
HISTORIC VICTORY: The Senate has voted to stop U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. This is the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war. 
".@SenSanders on the passage of his Yemen resolution: ""What we did today is basically say that the United States Congress is sick and tired of abdicating it’s responsibility- constitutional responsibility- on matters of war."""
"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Yemen vote: ""Both progressives and conservatives have made a profound statement that 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act...finally the United States Senate has come together to use that authority for the first time.""  "
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen has resulted in the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. That crisis is 85,000 children starving to death; 10,000 new cases of cholera every single week; and the United Nations telling us that Yemen is on the verge of imminent famine."
"What the Senate did today is say that the United States Congress is sick and tired of abdicating its constitutional responsibility on matters of war.

We will not continue to have our military posture dictated by a despotic, murderous regime in Saudi Arabia. "
"I want to thank my colleagues and the many people at the grassroots level who helped us pass this historic resolution. Today, 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act, the U.S. Senate finally used that authority for the first time."
".@SenSanders: 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act, the U.S. Senate has come together to use that authority for the first time in history and say that the constitutional responsibility for war rests with the Congress, not the president. "
Today we have brought Republicans and Democrats together in a very historic moment to take back the Congress' constitutional responsibility on matters of war. 
This is an historic day. For the first time in 45 years the U.S. Senate came together to end an unauthorized war. We have woken up the Congress to its constitutional responsibility. This is the beginning of a new day. 
"""We have woken up the United States Congress to its constitutional responsibilities""

@SenSanders was among those to pass a resolution to end to U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in #Yemen  "
"It's not just the Saudi-led war in Yemen or the brutal and cold-blooded murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It's the entire structure of the despotic Saudi regime.

The time is long overdue for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia.
"
"Today Gov. Scott Walker signed disgraceful, undemocratic legislation to limit the power of incoming Democratic officials in Wisconsin. Republicans like him across the country are attacking democracy and their power grabs must be stopped. "
"""You say you love your children above all else, yet you are stealing their futures right before their very eyes,"" - This 15-year-old activist @GretaThunberg just called out world leaders for their global inaction on climate change. "
"This is an outrageous, disastrous decision that threatens the health care and lives of millions of people. It must be overturned.

We must move forward to make health care a right for every American. "
"We must do everything we can to protect our democracy and work with allies to do the same.

Happy National Maple Syrup Day! Vermont is the biggest producer of maple syrup in America—producing nearly 2 million gallons of maple syrup last year alone. That's a lot of syrup. 
"U.S. student loan debt outstanding reached a record $1.465 trillion last month.

You know the most revolting part of this crisis?

The federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year."
"What I want to know is: if Sears has $25 million to give bonuses to executives, why is the company telling laid off employees they don't have the money to pay their severance? "
"I am working hard to reunite Shaima Swileh with her son before it’s too late. As a member of Congress, and a mother myself, the cruelty of barring a mother from reuniting with a sick child takes my breath away. This travel ban is inhumane and un-American.
"
"Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.

He lied. Bonuses are up $0.02/hr since the GOP tax cuts passed.

Our job: Repeal Trump’s tax breaks for the wealthy and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
"I'm glad the First Step Act passed. But there is much more needed to achieve comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must:

-End cash bail
-End private prisons
-End mandatory minimums
-Reinstate the federal parole system

Our primary goal must be rehabilitation, not punishment."
"Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.

What's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need."
"Nearly half of American adults have had an immediate family member incarcerated at some point. HALF.

Imagine what we could accomplish if we invested in jobs and education instead of paying $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people."
"Sanders, Feinstein Oppose Inclusion of Israel Anti-Boycott Act in Appropriations Bill "
"There's no greater disservice to our veterans than to deny them the VA health care they've earned by draining the VA of its resources in order to line the pockets of corporate CEOs.

If Trump thinks privatizing the VA is what's best for our veterans, he is dead wrong. "
".@SenSanders and @SenFeinstein ask not to sneak the Israel Anti-Boycott Act into the end-of-year omnibus spending bill. They cite ACLU legal victories in quashing anti-boycott laws in Arizona &amp; Kansas: “The courts’ reasoning in both those cases applies with equal force to S.720."" "
"Let’s be absolutely clear about what Trump is doing with his latest food stamps work requirements rule: he is attacking the poor.

We should be expanding programs like food stamps that lift people out of poverty, not making them even harder to access. "
"85,000 children have already starved to death as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.

Millions more face the prospect of famine and death.

The U.S. should be doing everything we can to support the ceasefire, not undermining it. Disgusting! "
"Trump, the “great friend” of American workers, is now prepared to ignore the unanimous U.S. Senate bill to fund the government.

While Trump heads off to his exclusive golf club in Florida, his Christmas gift to some 800,000 federal employees is to deny them their paychecks. "
"Last Tuesday, Trump said “I’m proud to shut down the government.” And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How’s that for a holiday gift?"
"This is what happened:

1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open
2) The House was ready to pass the bill
3) Rush and Fox &amp; Friends criticized Trump
4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas"
"If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday? I don’t think so!"
"""I am proud to shut down the government...  I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it."" –@realDonaldTrump, last Tuesday "
Trump's decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of a destructive pattern. The time is long overdue for congressional Republicans to stand up to him. 
"Think about it for a minute.

Democrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.

And then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic."
This president’s erratic and impulsive behavior is a danger to our country and a major impediment in terms of addressing the crises we face. His decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of this destructive pattern. 
"This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland:
-Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government.
-Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans.
- Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs."
"We must end the growing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and fight to preserve and strengthen family based agriculture. The American people deserve high quality, locally grown food. "
"Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live."
"Today, over 40 million Americans live in poverty - including millions of children and seniors.  As we enter the holiday season, and think about the future of our country, let us not forget the biblical admonishment: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."""
"While Trump talks about a ""booming economy,"" the reality for working families is:
-Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973
-80% live paycheck to paycheck
-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings
New Year’s Resolution: Create an economy that works for all."
Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
"As we celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace - and economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
"The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets—54% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist."
"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."
"As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better."
"The American people are tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us. They want policies which work for all, not just the wealthy few."
"The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world."
"If it is just ""bi-partisan politics"" to spend some $700 billion a year on the military, more than the next ten nations combined, why is it a ""radical"" idea to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free?"
One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, and then spends billions denying its responsibility.

We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
"Congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change.  Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV, which rarely discusses this issue? "
"Mr. President. Two children are dead because of your immigration policies. For once, be an adult. Stop blaming everyone else. Take responsibility for your actions. "
"As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year."
We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly.
"Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

We're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose."
"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
Trump is a pathological liar. How can we develop rational public policy when we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and falsehood? Not a good situation for the most powerful nation on Earth. 
"At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families."
I want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare for all. I’m confident the results will show that Medicare for all is the way forward if we want to guarantee heath care to all people in a cost-effective way. 
"Is it ""radical"" to demand that all Americans have health care, that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, that workers earn at least $15 an hour and that we transform our energy system in order to combat climate change? I don't think so."
"Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked ""the fraud of socialism."" Really? I wasn't aware that it was ""socialism"" that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started."
"Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now."
"President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due."
"If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country?

President Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees."
"The business model of Wall Street is fraud. When the 6 largest American banks have $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54% of our GDP, it's time to break them up. We need banks which invest in the real economy and create jobs, not rip us off.  "
"As a result of Trump's government shutdown, many federal employees will be unable to pay their mortgages or feed their kids. The Senate's first act must be to re-open the government.

Leader McConnell: Let the Senate vote on the House bills to re-open the government."
"Mr. President, I doubt very much that you can “relate” to federal workers.

When is the last time you had to choose between paying your mortgage, feeding your family or putting gas in the car?

End the shutdown. Pay federal employees. "
It’s absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. Democrats must block consideration of any bills that don’t reopen the government. Let's get our priorities right. 
Sen. Van Hollen is absolutely right. We should block consideration of all bills on the Senate floor until we end the Trump shutdown and reopen the federal government. 
"Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is ""an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery.""

Every day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government.

Democracy should be about one person, one vote—not billionaires buying elections."
"The U.S. has the world's largest economy. Yet, we lag far behind many other developed countries in health care, life expectancy, infant mortality, poverty, education and infrastructure.  We need a government that works for all, not just the 1%. "
"As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.

They're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.

Unbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action."
"There is no border crisis. The real crisis is that 800,000 people don’t know how they’ll pay their mortgages, pay student loans, put gas in their cars or put food on the table because of Donald Trump’s government shutdown. "
"The fight for Medicare for all will be opposed by all of the special interests—drug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street—who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system.

They may have the money. But we have the people.
"
"We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.

We need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure — roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing."
"97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the American people and stop simply obeying the dictates of the NRA.

We need to pass common sense gun safety legislation now. "
"Trump's reckless shutdown is threatening the livelihoods of some 800,000 federal workers. Mr. President: Enough is enough. Federal workers must be paid and the government must reopen. "
Democrats must block any legislation that does not reopen the government. It is absolutely absurd that the first Senate legislation during the shutdown is a bill which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. 
"Tonight I will deliver a live response to President Trump's Oval Office address, immediately following Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi's response. Tune in here:
 "
"President Trump, We don’t need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people. #BernieResponds "
"There's no crisis at the border. President Trump, you want to talk about crises?

-30 million Americans have no health insurance
-Climate change threatens our planet
-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings
-40 million are dealing with outrageous student debt"
"""Make no mistake, the Trump shutdown is anti-veteran,"" - This Iraq War Marine Corps veteran @will_c_fischer wants you to know that 31 percent of all federal employees are veterans and Trump is holding many of their paychecks hostage. (With @votevets) "
It gives me no pleasure to tell you what you already know: Trump lies all of the time and his speech last night was no exception. 
"Instead of trying to bring us together as a people, Trump is trying to divide us up. And, in the process, divert our attention away from the real crises facing the working families of this nation. "
"TODAY: Tune in live at 11:30 AM as Chairman @RepCummings, @SenSanders &amp; Rep.@RoKhanna unveil a legislative package to lower prescription drugs. #LowerDrugPrices
"
"At 11:30am ET, @SenSanders &amp; @RepCummings will hold a press conference to introduce three bills that dramatically lower prescription drug prices: "
"How many people need to die, how many people need to get unnecessarily sicker before Congress is prepared to take on the greed of the prescription drug industry?

Today, we are introducing legislation to end the pharmaceutical industry’s greed and drastically lower drug prices. "
"Prescription drug prices are out of control. Today, @SenSanders and I am announcing a package of bills that would drastically cut drug costs in the United States. Watch LIVE:
"
"Why do Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world?

Why are there no restrictions on what a drug company can charge?

The answer is simple: other than Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in the country."
".@SenSanders and others just introduced a slew of bills to lower drug prices and fight Big Pharma’s unimaginable greed.


Bernie’s message to Trump: If you truly agree Big Pharma is “getting away with murder,” support our legislation and get your Republican colleagues on board. "
"Sen. Bernie Sanders and co-sponsors introduce three pieces of legislation to reduce drug prices: ""The American people are demanding that Congress listen to their concerns and not power — not the power of the pharmaceutical industry, and today we do that""  "
"Sen. Bernie Sanders at union rally protesting government shutdown: ""Today we say to this president: Grow up, do your job, end this shutdown.""  "
"Trump has told the American people several hundred times that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is a lie. If his wall were to be built, Mexico would not pay for it. American taxpayers would."
"Today, @SenSanders &amp; @RepRoKhanna introduced the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act, which would drastically lower drug prices by taking on pharma monopolies. "
"In the richest country in the history of the world, Americans should not have to live in fear that they will die because they cannot afford the life-saving medication they need. Pharma's greed is killing Americans and that has got to end. (with @BizHealthPol) "
"Air traffic controllers got paychecks for a total of $0 today because of Trump's government shutdown.

This is a crisis!

Mr. Trump, stop holding our federal employees hostage as political pawns. Open the government now. "
"Last year, the five largest drug companies in America made nearly $60 billion in profits. The top five pharma CEOs made over $113 million in total compensation in 2017.

Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can’t afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress."
"Things that are national emergencies:
-30 million without health insurance
-15 million children in poverty
-Tens of thousands dying from opioids and gun violence
-Climate change

Things that are not national emergencies:
-Building a border wall to satisfy Fox News"
"There’s no crisis at the border but Trump’s shutdown is creating a crisis: The safety of the nation’s air travel system is at risk, tax refunds might not go out on time, national parks are overflowing with trash and hundreds of thousands of federal employees aren’t getting paid. "
"Today, the 3 wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our people, and income and wealth inequality is worse now than at any time since the 1920s. This is a moral outrage and bad economics. Not acceptable."
"Today, the top 0.1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%.

Uncontrolled greed cannot be the driving force behind our economy.

Our job: demand that all Americans have good paying jobs, health care, quality education, and a healthy environment."
"Do Trump and his billionaire friends understand that many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck? They have kids to feed and mortgages to pay.

Mr. President. Grow up. End the shutdown you created. Pay federal employees."
"Mr. President. Do you want to know what a real ""national emergency"" is? The scientists tell us that if we don't combat climate change aggressively, the severe damage done to our country and planet will be irreversible. Now that's a ""crisis."""
"The federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. That is why I, along with many other members of Congress, will introduce legislation this week to raise that wage to $15 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty."
"Enough is enough.

We are going to end the disgrace of health care being a privilege for the wealthy. We must pass Medicare for all and make health care a right. "
"In America, a woman—not the government or her employer—must control her own body. We must vigorously defend women’s access to all reproductive health services and allow them to make their own medical decisions.
"
"""[The animals] are being taken care of better than we are."" –Larry Howard, a worker at the National Zoo who doesn't know how he is going to pay his bills during Trump's shutdown.

Mr. President. Your actions have consequences. End your shutdown now and pay federal workers. "
"Trump says the economy is ""booming."" It is—for the top 10 CEOs who saw their combined compensation soar by 60% in 2017.

For the average worker, however, real wages went up by just 1.2% over the past year.

The very rich get richer. Working families continue to struggle."
"The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR’s vision that he laid out in 1944.

These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and we must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all. "
"We need a revolution in education. Teachers in LA should not be forced to strike for decent wages and smaller classes. All parents deserve high quality, affordable childcare.  Young people should not leave college deeply in debt. We must get our priorities right."
"Think big, not small. It is not ""radical"" to demand that all Americans receive decent wages, guaranteed health care, quality education, affordable housing and a clean environment. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%."
These three @SenSanders bills would arrest the highway robbery in the prescription drug market:  via @DeanBaker13
"While labor productivity has more than doubled since the late 1960s, nearly half of all new income generated in the U.S. since 1993 has gone to the top 1 percent.

This is what we mean when we say the economy is rigged in favor of the wealthy."
"The scientists tell us that the future of the planet is endangered by climate change. Meanwhile, because of Trump's government shutdown, about 95% of E.P.A. employees have been furloughed because they are ""non-essential."" How insane is that? "
"Nice reminder from @SenSanders that the shutdown is one more way we're not dealing with the climate crisis
"
"On nearly every ""radical"" idea the American people are with us:

72% want to expand Social Security.
70% want Medicare for All.
65% want a jobs guarantee.
64% want to legalize marijuana.
60% want tuition-free public colleges.
58% want $15 min wage.
57% want to break up big banks."
Racism and white supremacy have no place in Vermont. Kiah Morris was an excellent representative and our state is worse off without her in office. We must root out racism in Vermont and ensure that no one fears for their safety because of the color of their skin. 
"Trump's economy is great for billionaires, not for working people | Bernie Sanders "
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the wealthiest people in this country must start paying their fair share of taxes.

And we must do away with the massive loopholes that allow profitable corporations to stash billions of dollars in tax havens overseas. "
"Trump thinks we have ""the greatest economy in the history of America."" It may be great for his friends at Mar-a-Lago, but:

-The average worker makes less today than 43 years ago
-80% live paycheck to paycheck
-43% of households can't afford basic needs

"Today, along with Rep. @BobbyScott and 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors, I'm announcing the Raise the Wage Act to bring the federal minimum wage up to $15 an hour.

Watch our announcement live here:
"
"In 2015 there were 5 Senate cosponsors and 56 House cosponsors of @SenSanders’ bill to raise the minimum wage to $15.

Today there are 31 Senate cosponsors and 181 House cosponsors. "
"“It is not a radical idea that the economy should work for everyone and not just those at the very top,” says @SenSanders at the #RaiseTheWage introduction. Watch:  "
"Our $15 minimum wage bill would give a raise to over 40 million Americans, including more than half of African American and Latinx workers. A job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. It's time every worker in America is paid a living wage. "
"We need to change national priorities in this country. Instead of giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large, profitable corporations, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour."
"The person Donald Trump has nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't believe climate change is a ""crisis."" That is not only a disgrace, it is incredibly dangerous to the future of our planet. "
"When we raise the minimum wage to a living wage, poverty will go down and new jobs will be created. This a win-win for the economy and our country. It's time to pass a $15 minimum wage. "
"Bernie Sanders: ""We think we should pay attention to working people and raise the minimum wage to a living wage.""  "
"Yesterday Trump’s nominee to lead the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, wouldn't call climate change a crisis. And in his opening statement, he didn’t mention the words ""climate change"" once.

We need an administration that leads the world in combatting climate change, not denies this crisis. "
"It is disgraceful that we have a president who is holding hostage the paychecks of 800,000 federal employees all because he didn't like being attacked by Fox News. Mr. President, end this dangerous shutdown now. "
Bernie Sanders grilled Trump’s EPA nominee after the latter refused to affirm the scientific community’s conclusions on climate change 
"Over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income from the middle class to rich. Since 1979, the bottom 90% of Americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58% to just 46%—costing them nearly $11,000 per household."
"Maybe I’m the “radical” one, but I don’t think it's acceptable that the top 25 Wall Street hedge fund managers made over $15 billion in compensation in 2017—nearly double what all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America made last year."
Congratulations to @GovMurphy and the New Jersey state legislature for agreeing to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is a major step forward for economic justice. Our job now: pass $15 minimum wage legislation for ALL Americans. 
"Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been hailed as a progressive reformer. But his track record of imprisoning, torturing and murdering activists begs to differ. It's time that the U.S. and the international community hold this despotic regime accountable. "

"If this report is true, Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice—a felony and a potentially impeachable offense. I am glad that the House will be investigating this serious issue. "
"The wealth gap between white Americans and African Americans has more than TRIPLED over the past 50 years.

Today, the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family.

"President Trump said that ""nobody has been better at the military"" than him.

So why is he keeping the government shut down and leaving 42,000 service members without paychecks for the first time in history?"
"Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations."
"Since Trump was elected, the five richest people in America have seen their wealth go up by over $100 billion.

Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by $9.11 a week after adjusting for inflation.

That is the economic reality under Trump."
"No, President Trump, the economy is not “absolutely booming” when nearly 80 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck. Instead of an agenda for the wealthy few, we need to create an economy that works for all of us.

"Interesting. Trump and Putin are not only billionaire, anti-democratic authoritarians but they deny the crisis of climate change and push fossil fuels. What's the connection?"
"Trump is shutting down the government not just for his absurd wall. When you don't pay 800,000 federal workers you are destroying the concept of government in a democratic society, and moving to more privatization and corporate control over our lives."

"In a democratic society, people can have honest differences of opinion. It is difficult, however, to engage in policy discussion with someone like Trump who is a pathological liar. "
"We have a president who is a racist.

Today we say to Trump: We aren't going back to more bigotry, discrimination and division. We're going forward."
"9 years ago the disastrous Citizens United decision opened the door for billionaires and corporate interests to buy our elections.

To restore our one person, one vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop the slide to oligarchy."
"Trump says he supports the working class. Really? Today, as a result of his cruel government shutdown, 800,000 federal workers worry about how they will feed their kids, pay their mortgages or see a doctor. Mr. President. End the shutdown.

"We must stop incarcerating millions of Americans and funding militarism, and end racism in the criminal justice system and in the voting booth. Our attention should be on lifting up all Americans."
Discrimination has no place in our military or society. It is my hope that this temporary ruling will not be the final outcome. We must stand with trans service members. Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed.

The good news: We can revitalize our economy and create tens of millions of jobs in the process."
"If Trump were serious about protecting our national security, he would recognize that climate change is not a ""hoax"" and is already causing destruction and instability worldwide. The time for bold action is now."
"The economy is ""booming"" for Trump and his billionaire golfing buddies at Mar-a-Lago, but for the 80 percent of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, this is not an economy to be proud of. "
Congratulations to LA teachers for leading this country forward to ensure that all our children get a quality education. When we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.

.@SenSanders reintroducing (with House and Senate colleagues) legislation to end the US involvement in the war in Yemen- Sanders said it’s “essential that the House and Senate act very soon” as a ceasefire in Yemen may break down. 
"When Yemenis see “Made in USA” on the bombs that are killing them, it tells them that the USA is responsible for this war.

This is not the message we should be sending to the world. Congress must end support for the catastrophic war in Yemen led by a despotic Saudi regime."

"Incredibly, Republican leaders in the Senate have introduced a bill to repeal the estate tax for the richest 1,700 families in America. That's absurd.

From a moral, economic and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little."
"Our bill only applies to the richest 0.2% of Americans. It would establish a:

-45% tax on estate values $3.5M to $10M
-50% tax on estate values $10M to $50M
-55% tax on estate values over $50M
-77% tax on estate values over $1 billion"

"I say to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump: Instead of repealing the estate tax, let’s substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America. "

I have a better idea: raise the estate tax so that billionaires pay their fair share. "
"Pharma companies lied about the addictive impacts of opioids, yet not one of them has been held fully accountable for this crisis.

"The grotesque level of wealth inequality, from a moral, economic and political perspective, is the great challenge we face. We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little."
"Trump’s withdrawal from the INF treaty is dangerous and irresponsible. We should strengthen these treaties, not end them. We should invest in our children, our seniors and our working families, not in an incredibly expensive arms race."
"After 35 days of pain and suffering for federal workers and contractors during the Trump shutdown, what's the first thing that the GOP leadership decides to do? Make the wealthiest families in America even richer. "
Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia.
Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short.
"Remember when Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families?

The reality: bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since Trump’s tax plan was signed into law. Two cents."
Let's not kid ourselves. What we have today is a campaign finance system that amounts to legalized bribery.
"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a life-saving drug from $0 to $375,000.

Now patients are worried they are going to suffer or even die because of the greed of a drug company.

If Catalyst does not substantially lower the price of this medication, Congress must act. "
"Today, I am demanding that Catalyst explain why they raised the price of this drug by $375,000. No one in the United States of America should die because they cannot afford the medication they need. "
"Walmart is spending $20 billion on a share repurchase program.

With a fraction of that amount, Walmart could have raised hourly wages of every employee to $15.

Corporations should address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders. "
"Instead of repealing the estate tax and giving a massive tax cut to the Walton family and Kochs as Mitch McConnell and Trump want to do, let’s substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America. "
".@SenSchumer &amp; @SenSanders argue that when corporations dedicate so much of their resources to buying back shares, they restrain their capacity to reinvest profits more meaningfully "
"Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a blistering letter to a pharmaceutical company on Monday, demanding answers about its decision to charge $375,000 for a formerly low-cost drug and calling it corporate greed at its worst "
I stand with @transportworker fighting to keep us safe and to keep airline mechanics jobs in America. 
"✔️buy a decades-old drug
✔️raise the price by $375,000
✔️promise shareholders millions
✔️hope you get away with it

The business model of big pharma is greed. What Catalyst did to the LEMS community, and to Rebecca Hovde, is wrong. "
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. 25 hedge fund managers earn twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers. One family (Kochs) spent $400 million to buy elections. That's why we need a political revolution."
"Walmart’s decision to provide 48 hours of paid sick leave to some employees is a small step forward, but not nearly good enough. This is not a poor company. Walmart can and must pay all of its workers at least $15 an hour with good benefits. "
"Stacey Abrams is a great choice to deliver the Democratic response. I'm very much looking forward to her speech.

For the third year in a row, following the Democratic rebuttal I'll be on Facebook Live, Twitter and YouTube to respond to Trump. "

My @NYTimes op-ed with @SenSanders: "
"Today on Rosa Parks' 106th birthday we must do more than just remember her lifetime of organizing. We must honor her by working to fulfill her vision of racial, economic and social justice. "
"Instead of wasting billions on a wall with Mexico, tax breaks for billionaires and a bloated military budget, we need to end childhood poverty, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, combat climate change and invest in our kids and seniors."
.@SenSchumer and I are here to say: corporations must address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders. Our bill will prohibit corporations from buying back stock unless they invest in workers and communities first. 
Congratulations to New Jersey and @GovMurphy for signing a bill today to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now we must ensure a livable wage in all 50 states. 
It was a Republican president — not Bernie Sanders — who first argued for the creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth. Mitch McConnell might want to listen. 
"Republicans officials don't push the myth of voter fraud because it is an actual problem. They push it to maintain the racist voting laws that have kept them in power for generations. The real problem we face is voter suppression.
"
"Today, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation, our child care system is dysfunctional, our teachers are underpaid and many public schools are struggling. We need to invest in our kids, not a wall with Mexico."
"Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, is correct that the money from stock buybacks “doesn't vanish.” It increases the wealth of billionaires like him. Instead of making the very rich even richer, how about increasing wages for American workers. Is that a bad idea? "
Will Trump talk about climate change in his State of the Union address tonight?
"Let me guess. President Trump tonight will talk about crimes committed by undocumented Latinos. Do you think he will mention the mass shootings done by white men, or the need for common sense gun safety legislation?"
Fox News can't believe their own poll says people want to tax the rich. The truth is: The overwhelming majority of the American people want the wealthy to pay their fair share. 
"Now that that’s over, please watch my friend Stacey Abrams share her message for the country. "
My response to President Trump’s State of the Union address: 
"Despite what President Trump says, it is not “a hot economy” when 43% of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone without going into debt. That is not a hot economy. #SOTU"
How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? #SOTU
Tonight Trump—who in less than two years in the White House has seen 5 aides either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges—claimed the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations. The exact opposite is true. #SOTU
"Trump said tonight, “We are born free, and we will stay free.”

I say to Trump: People are not truly free when they can’t afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families. #SOTU"
"If we are serious about transforming our country, rebuilding the middle class and reinvigorating our democracy: let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. #SOTU"
"Tonight, Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-women attacks coming from the far right. At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman’s right to choose, we must fight to make sure that every woman has the right to control her own body. #SOTU"
"One vial of insulin cost $21 in 1996, compared to $320 in 2018. American lives are being lost because of pharma's greed. That has got to end. "
"All Americans have a right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Yet Andrew Wheeler, Trump's nominee to lead the EPA, won't commit to regulating a family of toxic chemicals found in our drinking water. "
"We have got to think big, not small. Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. Why can't we do the same?"
"Trump talks a lot about ""freedom."" But people are not truly free when they have no health care or can't afford to feed their families. They are not free when they must work 80 hours a week on starvation wages. "
"""Our progress has always found refuge in the basic instinct of the American experiment—to do right by our people. And with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together."" –@staceyabrams "
"Yes, the economy is great—for the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck."
"Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.

We are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"Mr. Trump, you are dead wrong. This is not a ""hot economy"" when 62 percent of jobs in America cannot support a middle class life. "
"No one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law. "
Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. A Green New Deal can save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
"Trump's top intelligence officials, European allies, national security and nonproliferation experts: The Iran nuclear deal works.

Trump: No. "
"I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal proposal. We must address the existential crisis of planetary climate change, while at the same time creating millions of good-paying jobs in our country. "
"Donald Trump’s relentless attacks on our political institutions not only undermine our democracy, they also embolden authoritarian leaders around the world. "
"President Trump. Do not shut down the government again. Another Trump shutdown would be not only harmful to our federal workers, but also to the safety and security of our nation. "
I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign.
"Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it’s wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public."
"Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families. No. It's time to enact a progressive estate tax and start investing in programs that actually help working families, not the top 0.2%. "
"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable. "
"President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change.

I believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy."
"The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry—but ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system."
Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people.
"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored. "
The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
"While psychologists tell us that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which underpays staff and is too costly for working families. We need universal, publicly funded childcare.
"
"Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!"
"What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour?"
"Trump is worried about America becoming a ""socialist nation."" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country."
We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
"Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes."
"75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today."
"In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike"
"Our infrastructure is collapsing, our health care system is dysfunctional, our political system is corrupt and we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change."
Watch this progressive economist @lenorepalladino explain to Trump's chief economist how large corporations use stock buybacks to enrich their shareholders at the expense of workers. 
"Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all.

97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can’t afford their medication. Outrageous."
"What kind of economy allows for the top 0.00025% of the population to own more wealth than the bottom 150 million? A rigged economy.

That is why we demand that the very wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes."
"If Trump shuts down the government again, planes may not be flying. The Association of Flight Attendants believes that another shutdown would threaten the safety and security of airline passengers and employees. No more shutdowns! "
"How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage? It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. "
"Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that."
"Our health care system today essentially says that if you happen to be poor, you are less deserving of getting care than a wealthy person. That is fundamentally immoral and that is not the kind of nation we should be."
We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave. #FAMILYAct
"It is not too much to demand that in our democracy, everyone 18 years of age should be automatically registered to vote. End of discussion."
"The American people understand that a moral society doesn't give tax breaks to billionaires and then cut back on the needs of seniors or people with disabilities, as our Republican colleagues have proposed.

Today, I am introducing legislation to expand Social Security. "
"Today, @SenSanders &amp; @RepPeterDeFazio are introducing the Social Security Expansion Act. Social Security is the most successful government program in history. It is time to #ScraptheCap and #ExpandSocialSecurity."
"At a time when half of older Americans have zero retirement savings, we are not going to cut Social Security, as my Republican colleagues have proposed. We are going to expand Social Security and ensure everyone can retire with dignity. #ScrapTheCap "
"Donald Trump made $694 million in 2016. That means he stopped paying Social Security taxes 40 minutes into the year.

Meanwhile a middle-class worker paid Social Security taxes the entire year.

I say to Trump: pay your fair share. Let's scrap the cap and expand Social Security."
"I will vote against William Barr’s nomination. I cannot support someone for attorney general who will not make public the full Mueller report, who opposes a woman’s right to control her own body and who supports the failed war on drugs. Mr. Barr’s nomination must be defeated."
"The only way we will pass a Green New Deal and take the bold action required to combat climate change is if millions of young people stand up and demand that we rapidly transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.

Thank you @sunrisemvmt for helping to lead the movement. "
"The Social Security Expansion Act from @SenSanders would:
✓ Increase monthly Social Security benefits
✓ Help low income retirees stay out of poverty
✓ Make the wealthy pay their fair share"
"Amazon made $16.8 billion in profits over the past two years but have paid ZERO in federal income taxes. In fact it got a $269 million tax refund.

Our job: Demand large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so that we can rebuild the disappearing middle class."
I applaud my House colleagues for today’s historic passage of HJ Res 37 – ending U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Senate must quickly pass this resolution and finally reassert Congress' constitutional authority over war. 
"Today we remember the Parkland students and teachers who lost their lives.

Thank you to the young people who have courageously led the movement to end gun violence. With your leadership and the strong support of the American people we will pass commonsense gun safety legislation"
"The great economic crisis we face is the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. When so few have so much, and so many have so little, a handful of billionaires end up controlling our economic and political life. That has got to change. "
"There is not a ""national emergency"" with regard to the southern border. What President Trump is doing is unlawful and must be opposed vigorously in the courts and legislatively."
"While I have concerns about this bill, I supported it because I can’t turn my back on the 2 million federal employees and private contractors who would be forced again to work without pay. I am also concerned about the millions who would be denied access to government services. "
"If you paid the $119 annual fee to become an Amazon Prime member, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in taxes.

Our job: Repeal all of the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations and demand that they pay their fair share in taxes. "
"The American people, the Congress and the courts must show Trump what the Constitution and separation of powers is about. Trump cannot declare a ""national emergency"" whenever he wants, and spend money on his pet project. Not gonna happen!"
"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. We have a constitution and separation of powers. There is no ""national emergency,"" and Trump cannot build his wall without congressional approval."
"The current fight in DC is about more than a wall. It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. The American people must inform Trump that we will not become an authoritarian nation."
"Let me congratulate the @fightfor15 movement for winning another historic victory.

The American people understand that we must raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage – at least $15 an hour.

And that is exactly what we'll do! "

"Artificial intelligence and robotics are positive creations of the human mind. They should be used to improve the lives of working people, not just to increase corporate profits.  Human beings must control technology, not the other way around."
"Why does Trump want to repeal the estate tax? Maybe because without it, a majority of the assets held by households worth $100 million or more would never be taxed.

"Congratulations to @BobbyScott and every Democrat on the @EdLaborCmte for passing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $15 an hour.

A job should lift Americans out of poverty, not keep them in it. "
"Medicare for All is the only solution to our current wasteful, for-profit health care system. "

"In the United States, you should not be in danger of losing your home because you get sick. We need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower drug prices. "
"Congratulations to UE Locals 506 and 618 for their successful effort in standing up for justice and dignity.

This is a victory for workers across the country who are sick and tired of seeing their standard of living decline as a result of corporate greed. "

"This is a budget for the military-industrial complex, for corporate CEOs, for Wall Street and for the billionaire class.

We don’t need billions of dollars for a wall that no one wants. We need a budget that works for all Americans, not just Trump and his billionaire friends. "
"Trump's budget is breathtaking in its cruelty. It cuts:

- $1.5 trillion from Medicaid
- $845 billion from Medicare
- $25 billion from Social Security

This budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people."
"We spend more on the military than the next 10 countries combined.

Now Trump is proposing an $861 billion increase in base defense spending over 10 years.

And he wants to pay for it by cutting over $1 trillion from programs working families depend on. That is a disgrace."

Donald Trump's budget is not only an absolute disaster – full of ideas that the American people have already rejected – it exposes Trump for the fraud that he is. 
Wealth inequality in America is at an all-time high. It's time we make millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. 
"Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world due to the Saudi-led war.

The U.S. has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. Too often, our weapons are being used to kill civilians.

This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all. 
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day? 
The war in Yemen is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster. Let us bring this catastrophic and unconstitutional war in Yemen to an end today.

I frankly do not understand why Republicans seem to hate providing health care to the American people.

No American should have to go without basic health care. Community health centers are a critical lifeline for millions of Americans. @WhipClyburn and I are working to expand them to everyone who needs care.
