2) North Korea. Trump should use the G20 to develop a consensus. Real leadership is bringing parties together to de-escalate tensions.

"At a time of massive concentration of ownership in the financial sector, now is not the time to deregulate banks that have more than $3.5 trillion in assets and lay the groundwork for another massive financial collapse."
Today my Republican colleagues along with some Democrats tell us that we should be spending our time deregulating some of the largest banks in America. How absurd is that? https://t.co/Goap3W4LOd https://t.co/o8pgs6XUxR
"I hear from a lot of people in Vermont and around the country. I have not heard one person say, ""Bernie, we have got to deregulate 25 of the largest banks in this country with cumulative assets of $3.5 trillion."" Yet that is what Congress is debating doing today."
"Why is Congress busy worrying about the needs of huge financial institutions, but ignores the concerns of ordinary Americans? The answer is simple. Follow the money."
"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions, and last year spent over $200 million on lobbying. That is why Congress will be spending day after day trying to make life easier for large financial institutions."
"I have a radical idea. Instead of listening to lobbyists in Washington, maybe, just maybe, we should listen to the American people who believe we should strengthen, not weaken, Wall Street regulations."

"For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war. That is the debate we are going to have today. https://t.co/SAXpga0qrX"
Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the issue of war https://t.co/BPvBGdENqH
"The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war."
"I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked “Made in the USA,"" dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military."
"So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen:
-Over 10,000 civilians have been killed
-Over 3 million have been displaced
-15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation
-More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported"
Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
"LBJ’s administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War.

Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth."
"The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse."
6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity – in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
"I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences."
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help."

President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is the latest in a series of reckless decisions that move our country closer to conflict.
"Real American power is not shown by our ability to blow things up, but by our ability to forge international consensus around shared problems. That is what the Iran agreement did.

Today President Trump put us on a very different, more dangerous path."

How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? #SOTU
Tonight Trump—who in less than two years in the White House has seen 5 aides either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges—claimed the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations. The exact opposite is true. #SOTU
"Trump said tonight, “We are born free, and we will stay free.”

I say to Trump: People are not truly free when they can’t afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families. #SOTU"
"If we are serious about transforming our country, rebuilding the middle class and reinvigorating our democracy: let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. #SOTU"
"Tonight, Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-women attacks coming from the far right. At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman’s right to choose, we must fight to make sure that every woman has the right to control her own body. #SOTU"
"One vial of insulin cost $21 in 1996, compared to $320 in 2018. American lives are being lost because of pharma's greed. That has got to end. https://t.co/3CiFCdjU4A"

"We have got to think big, not small. Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. Why can't we do the same?"
"Trump talks a lot about ""freedom."" But people are not truly free when they have no health care or can't afford to feed their families. They are not free when they must work 80 hours a week on starvation wages. https://t.co/TjohBJFhj7"
"""Our progress has always found refuge in the basic instinct of the American experiment—to do right by our people. And with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together."" –@staceyabrams https://t.co/PjBsW8rYBZ"
"Yes, the economy is great—for the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck."
"Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.

We are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."

"No one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law. https://t.co/IZOFVz8otn"

I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign.
"Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it’s wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public."
"Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families. No. It's time to enact a progressive estate tax and start investing in programs that actually help working families, not the top 0.2%. https://t.co/EDUd49hhmU"
"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable. https://t.co/tsOvYYRekZ"
"President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change.

I believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy."
"The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry—but ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system."
Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people.
"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored. https://t.co/x4mMXk7liD"
The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
"While psychologists tell us that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which underpays staff and is too costly for working families. We need universal, publicly funded childcare.

"Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!"
"What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour?"
"Trump is worried about America becoming a ""socialist nation."" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country."
We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
"Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes."
"75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today."
"In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike"

"Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that."
