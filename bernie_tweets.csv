"Donald says he will ""fix"" trade.  He can start by shutting down his own sweatshops in Bangladesh and pay workers in the U.S. a living wage."
Wanna know why Trump believes wages are too high in the U.S.?  He is used to paying 30 cents an hour in low-wage countries abroad.
"How serious is Trump about fixing the trade problem? From (now-defunct) Trump University: Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run."
"He's the poster child of failed trade policies:"
"Meanwhile, Trump is proposing huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while gutting the Department of Education and the EPA."
Trump's plan to repeal the estate tax alone would give a $269 billion tax break over a 10-year period to the top two-tenths of 1 percent.
"In total, Trump wants to provide a $3 trillion tax cut to Americans who make over $1 million a year."
"The TPP will cost American jobs, harm the environment and threaten our ability to protect public health.

"In the 81 years since FDR signed Social Security into law, it has been one of the nation’s most successful anti-poverty programs. #SocSec81"
"Wall Street and right-wing misinformation tell us Social Security, which is funded by the payroll tax, is going broke. They're dead wrong."
Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus. It can pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 19 years. #SocSec81
"Right now a billionaire pays the same amount of money into Social Security as someone who makes $118,500 a year."
We can lift this cap so that everyone making over $250k a year pays into Social Security and extend its solvency for the next 50 years.
"Not only is this the right thing to do from a moral perspective, it is also what the vast majority of the American people want us to do."
"Do you know what workers fought for 100 years ago? A 40-hour workweek. 100 years ago. Today, we still have not achieved that goal."

In America today we have a grotesque level of wealth &amp; income inequality in which the top 0.1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
.@realDonaldTrump’s solution to massive inequality is to provide a tax break worth $353 billion to the top 0.2% by ending the estate tax.
.@HillaryClinton understands we need a tax system which asks billionaires to pay their fair share &amp; reduces the obscene level of inequality.
A progressive estate tax on the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans is the fairest way to reduce wealth inequality and invest in working families.
.@realDonaldTrump's plan to eliminate the estate tax wouldn't help working families. It's a $4 billion tax break for his own family.

Trump's focus should not be a few people who might burn the American flag. It should be on working families and combatting climate change.
America remains the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. The Republican response: throw millions off health insurance.
Trump attacked Wall Street on the campaign. Now he nominates a former Goldman Sachs executive to be Treasury secretary. What hypocrisy!
I appreciate @POTUS listening to the Native Americans and millions of others who believe the Dakota Access Pipeline shouldn't be built.

There is hatred being generated against immigrants in this country. We've got to stand together and reject that hate.
"Young people in this country should be in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells."
A small subsection of the one percent are hell-bent on doing everything in their power to block action against climate change.
"Our job is to grow the union movement so that anyone working 40 hours a week, whether it’s in a factory or a hotel, doesn't live in poverty."
Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who do not want cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.
Walmart costs taxpayers $6.2 billion every year in public assistance programs by not paying their workers a living wage. That is insane.
"Even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost 4x more likely to be arrested for possession."
Cuts to life and death programs like Medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthy—that's not what America is supposed to be about.
There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
It would be nice to put off worrying about climate change for a few decades. But the truth is we have no choice but to act now.
Every person in this country deserves a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living. Until that happens we will not truly be free.
"Lowering prices on prescription drugs—that is, making sure that people can afford to live—should not be a partisan issue."
"Clinton received almost 3 million more votes, but Trump will be the next president. It's clear the electoral college needs to be changed."
"We are moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and it will take all of us to fight against it."
It is beyond absurd that so many bright young people are unable to attend college because of the cost.
Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a clear example of why we need fundamental changes in our national priorities
Believing in climate change is not optional at this point. Neither is taking action to save the planet.

"If Mr. Trump tries to pursue discriminatory policies, he should remember that a majority of voters did not support him and his bigotry."

"For decades, Republicans and Democrats have understood that the goal must be to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, not expand them."

"Democrats must start playing ball in states that we have conceded decades ago, where people are now being left out of the political process."
"While tens of millions of children around the world go hungry and uneducated, a handful of billionaires divide up the riches of the planet."

"If we claim to be the greatest nation on Earth, then we've got to catch up to other major countries and guarantee health care for all."
It doesn't make sense to trust billionaires to fight for the working class. The billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the American people.
25 states and cities raised minimum wages this year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.
My nightmare is our grandchildren wondering why we did not leave them a planet that is habitable.
"Here's a radical idea.  Let's create an economy that works for the bottom 99%, not just the people on top."
Members of Congress spend way too much time in pursuit of money and too little time actually debating the issues.
I wish elected officials would spend less time making it harder for people to vote and more time fighting for the working class.
"While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right, we spend more on our military than the next seven nations combined."
"Our goal must be to improve the VA, not destroy it. We will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the VA."
The U.S. shouldn’t discourage kids who want to go to college with massive costs. We should be educating as many people as we possibly can.
You cannot be a party which takes money from Wall Street and then tells working families you are on their side. People see through that.
Cities and towns and states have stepped up and raised the minimum wage to $15. It’s about time that Congress does the same for all workers.
Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 30 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. That should not be the case when people’s lives are at stake.
Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible.
"Happy New Year! Never forget greed is powerful but our vision of a world based on economic, social &amp; environmental justice is more powerful."
"When we fight we’re fighting for the future—the future of the planet in terms of climate change, and for the future of American democracy."
Republicans are not going to get away with punishing the poor while rewarding their billionaire friends.
Working people are angry and they have a right to be angry. This economy isn’t for them—it’s for the extremely wealthy.
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.

NowThis sat down with @BernieSanders in Michigan this weekend to discuss the fight to save the Affordable Care Act https://t.co/jQL7NAQKGc
"If Republicans think they're simply going to throw millions off of health insurance, they’ve got another thing coming."
"There should be no disagreement that the First Family represented us with extraordinary dignity, grace and civility over the last 8 years."
"Our response to Mr. Trump's inauguration has to be to fight back for economic, social, environmental &amp; racial justice. We're not giving up!"
We must vigorously defend DACA and the young people in that program and fight for immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.
"We won't achieve our goals if we treat democracy as a spectator sport, hoping others will do it. They won’t. The future is in our hands."
"Tomorrow morning: @BernieSanders weighs in on how Democrats should approach Obamacare, the Supreme Court, and more. https://t.co/g8EmjygO9a"
"This morning: @BernieSanders weighs in on how Democrats should approach Obamacare, the Supreme Court, and more."
President Trump: Women aren’t going back to second-class citizenship. They are going forward. We are all in this together.
The simple truth is that we’ll never have the health care system we need if private insurance companies and drug companies run the show.
"Republicans want to repeal the ACA, but their alternative (if they ever come up with one) will likely be much worse. https://t.co/F28Iur0W7t"
"If Mr. Trump is serious about standing up for working families, he won't throw 20 million working people off of health insurance."
"If the ACA is repealed, researchers tell us that 43,000 Americans could die. That’s beyond comprehension. https://t.co/E4lqfWnTg3"
"It’d be funny if it wasn't so absurd: Trump, a billionaire, surrounded at his inauguration by billionaires, says he's anti-establishment."

"President Trump said the other day that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the election. That’s delusional, an ""alternative fact."""
The great political and democratic crisis we now face is not voter fraud. It doesn’t exist. It is voter suppression.
Congress and the American people must defend American values. No torture!
Is Trump already in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution? https://t.co/uVqKGsQCIg
"We need a qualified and knowledgable Education Secretary, not a billionaire who contributed hundreds of millions to right-wing Republicans."

"Putting Steve Bannon, an extreme right-wing operative, on the National Security Council is dangerous and he should be removed."
"Given Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional actions, the Democratic Party can no longer do politics ""as usual."""
"We should be looking for guidance now not from pollsters and political consultants, but from leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr."
"We believe in a nation based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice and we've just begun to fight back."

"We are a democracy, not a one-man show. We are not another Trump enterprise."
"I want a Supreme Court that will stand up for civil liberties, constitutional rights, workers' rights, environmental rights, women's rights."
"Surprise, surprise. Trump has turned his back on everything he said in the campaign and cozied up to Wall Street. https://t.co/vbvGsjUJOC"
Donald Trump is a fraud. He said during the campaign he would take on Wall Street and now he's working for Wall Street.
"When Republicans say they want to ""save"" or ""strengthen"" Social Security, what they mean is that they want to cut Social Security benefits."
"The choice on DeVos is clear. We need to protect children with disabilities, not ignore their needs. #NoOnDeVos"

"I’ve been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: Yes, health care is a right of all people. #DebateWithBernie"
A Medicare-for-all system would save us hundreds of billions in health care costs a year. It’s financially smart and the moral thing to do.
We're having an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation. We are talking about taking health care away from 30 million people.
"In the midst of massive wealth inequality, @tedcruz doesn't just want to take away health care, he wants to give huge tax breaks to the 1%."
CEOs of drug companies should not be making millions when customers are dying because they cannot afford their medication. #DebateWithBernie
It is unconscionable that Sen. Mitch McConnell silenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren because she read a letter from Coretta Scott King.
"When I read the same letter as @SenWarren, no one prevented me from speaking. Sen. McConnell owes Sen. Warren an apology. #LetLizSpeak"
We need an Attorney General who’ll defend the Constitution &amp; educate the president about what it means. Jeff Sessions won't be that person.
Trump has sent many tweets the last few months. But where's the tweet saying he’ll keep his promise to not cut Medicare and Medicaid?
"Whether it is in conservative parts of the country or in progressive areas, the American people are fighting back. https://t.co/xIhj3j0MbM"
"Our job is to stand together, vigorously oppose Trump's racist immigration policies and fight for policies that work for working families."
When Donald Trump attacks the  media as “fake news” what he is doing is trying to move our country in an authoritarian direction.
"Trump is a total hypocrite. He campaigned saying I'm going to take on Wall Street, and then he hires the president of Goldman Sachs."
We’ve got to bring people together around a progressive agenda. They want to raise the minimum wage and make health care a right.
What I say to the American people is: stay focused. We will fight for an economy that works for all and doesn’t just benefit the wealthy.
"Trump old workers he would stand up for them and stand up to Wall Street. Now, the same old Wall Street insiders are running the show."
"Our job is to grow the trade union movement so that workers, white collar and blue collar, can stand up and fight for their rights."
"Our job: Break up the major financial institutions, not appoint more Wall Street executives to the administration as Trump has done."
We need to know if President Trump's foreign policy represents the best interests of this country or the best interests of Russia.
"We need a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers, raising the minimum wage &amp; pay equity for women. Mr. Puzder was not that candidate."

Scientists are virtually unanimous that climate change is real and caused by human activity. Mr. Pruitt refuses to recognize that.
"We need an EPA administrator whose priority is the safety of people, not the profits of the fossil fuel industry. Pruitt is not that person."
Talk about cowardice. Republicans are trying to ram through Pruitt's confirmation before the American people find out what is in his emails.
"Instead of draining the swamp, Trump is filling it up with the same old Wall Street insiders, whose greed nearly destroyed our economy."
Great news! Now is the time for Keith Ellison to become chair of the Democratic Party. https://t.co/471e8OB6xq
"According to Trump, if you want the truth, ignore everything except what he is saying. That's what totalitarianism is all about. https://t.co/JFwpMpLj3u"
Trump: Want to know what fake news is? Your denial of climate change and the lies spread by fossil fuel companies to protect their profits.
I would hope that Republicans have the courage to stand up to Trump's movement to authoritarianism.
"Our diversity is our strength. We must take pride in that, not let hatred divide us."
25 states and cities raised minimum wages last year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.
Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 20 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
"It appears Mr. Trump, who attacks media that makes critical remarks about him as “fake news,” doesn't understand what democracy is about."
Our nation worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don’t believe that is the nation we should be living in.
If you're rich and powerful and commit illegal behavior you get promoted to the president's cabinet. There’s something very wrong with that.
"Our job today: strengthen Obamacare and stop the repeal. Tomorrow, we must join the rest of the world and guarantee health care for all."
"When Trump and his friends make delusional statements about ""voter fraud,"" they are setting the stage for an increase in voter suppression."
"Obamacare isn’t perfect. But the solution is not to throw millions off health care without a replacement plan and say, “You're on your own."""
The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.
"This is no time for despair or giving up. This is a time for organizing, educating and fighting back."
"At a time of grotesque income inequality, the rich do not need more tax breaks and working people do not need cuts to basic needs."
"We will not allow Republicans to punish the elderly, children, the sick and the poor, while they reward their billionaire friends."
"We will lose our fights for justice when we are divided or apathetic, and the fights we face now are far too important to risk that."
"Here's why I believe Keith Ellison is the right choice to serve as the next Chair of the Democratic Party:

"If Donald Trump and Paul Ryan’s ""health care” plan is adopted, thousands of Americans will die. This bill is a disgrace."
"Our job is to provide health care for all people as a human right, not throw 24 million Americans off the health insurance that they have."
"'Throwing millions of people off of healthcare is not healthcare legislation'— @BernieSanders, deep in the heart of Trump territory https://t.co/jAPTHkpzus"
Donald Trump's tax plan would mean huge breaks for millionaires like Trump https://t.co/IKVPNjdNKV by @cgfaricy
The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies and get the health care they choose. No cuts to Planned Parenthood.
"The GOP alternative to Obamacare is grotesque and ugly. You don't throw 24 million people off health care and call it ""health care reform."""
We must guarantee health care as a right. People who can’t afford care deserve to live as much as those who can.
"Here’s a radical idea. Let’s make our economy work for all of us, not just the top 1%."
"For someone who talked about draining the swamp and standing up to Wall Street, Trump has a funny way of doing so. https://t.co/RLEAWSDs7V"
"Amidst Trump’s antics we must not lose sight of a progressive agenda focused on racial, social, environmental and economic justice."
The great political and democratic crisis we now face is not voter fraud. It is voter suppression.
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
"Being involved in politics is not just about elections. It is fighting for racial, social, economic and environmental justice every day."

"When Wall Street talks, Congress listens. When working class kids talk about being saddled with horrendous debts, who is listening to them?"
"Let us never forget that in 2008, Wall Street’s greed, recklessness and illegal behavior nearly destroyed our economy"
We should call the Republican health care plan what it really is: a massive tax break for those who are the wealthiest in America.
We must never forget. Health care is a human right. All people are entitled to coverage.

Trump promised “insurance for everybody.” Apparently “everybody” doesn’t include the 24 million they are taking health care away from.
Republicans' health care plan—tax breaks for millionaires and raised premiums for seniors—isn’t what a civilized society is about.
Republicans are scrambling on their health care plan and they are embarrassed. They’re on the defensive. Keep fighting back.
Our true goal is not just stopping Republicans from destroying health care. Our goal is guaranteeing health care as a right to all people.
This is a major victory for working families and everyone who attended rallies and town hall meetings in opposition to this disastrous bill. https://t.co/vRHtXAY6GF
Joining @chrislhayes tonight: @BernieSanders and @MMFlint #inners https://t.co/9oCLcbav5d
We must be clear. This important victory against the Republican health care plan is not the end of our work. It is the beginning.
"We now must take on a horrific Republican budget and efforts at ""tax reform"" which means huge tax breaks to billionaires and corporations."

How Bernie Sanders’ ideas are winning in the Trump era https://t.co/9y7mc82PFH https://t.co/4DkCh4cijs
"Unbelievably, 20 Americans own as much wealth as the bottom half of America. One family, the Waltons, owns more wealth than the bottom 42%."
We are going to take on the billionaire class and transform this country so it works for everyone not just the 1%. https://t.co/7fw0sgAhrI
"The American people don't believe we should throw millions of people who have been here for years, raising their kids, out of this country."
"Republicans have the money, but we have the people. And when we organize we are going to create the nation we all know we can become."
This is the United States of America. We should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.
"38 years ago, the top 0.1% owned about 7% of our nation’s wealth. Today, that same 0.1% owns 22% of the wealth."
"Mr. Trump: We have come too far in this country in overcoming racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia to go back."
"Despite the disaster of the Trump presidency, our progressive ideas are winning. https://t.co/Pa5dfVCMhB"
"Ordinary people are taking matters into their own hands to transform our energy system, with or without Washington's help. That matters."
Remember: defeating Republicans’ Obamacare repeal was just the start. Our job is to keep fighting for affordable health care for everyone.
"Real change will not be led from Washington, DC. It will be led at the grassroots level in 50 states."
"A student who studies hard gets hit with insurmountable debt, yet bankers who crashed our economy got a bailout. How does that make sense?"
Bernie Sanders Just Introduced His Free College Tuition Plan https://t.co/qFEU2otoyR
We need to educate all our people in order to address the crises facing us. The way to do that is making higher education affordable to all.

My parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents they'd see their kids go to college. We must keep that promise to every family.

We need to make the Democratic Party a party not just for the east coast and west coast but a party for all 50 states.
Donald Trump said he would stand with the working people of this country. Good speech but unfortunately it wasn't true.
You don't stand with workers when you propose massive increases in military spending but cut back on programs for the elderly and children.
You don't stand with workers when you propose massive tax cuts for the rich and take health care away from millions of Americans.

"While the middle class is shrinking, we will not be part of a process which takes from those families to give even more to the very rich."
@SenCapito: In America we’re not supposed to take from the most vulnerable people in order to give massive tax breaks to billionaires.
How can you draft a bill of such enormous magnitude without one public comment from experts who are most knowledgeable about health care?
This legislation is fatally flawed. No small tweak here or there will undo the massive damage it will cause to West Virginia and the nation.
What kind of country are we when anyone could think about cutting help to disabled kids in order to give tax breaks to billionaires?
West Virginia’s overdose death rate is the highest in the U.S. We need more funding to address the crisis—not nearly $800B in Medicaid cuts.
"When workers in West Virginia have two or three jobs to stay alive, you don’t take away their health care to give billionaires tax breaks."
A great nation is not judged its number of billionaires or the tax breaks they get. It's judged by how we treat the most vulnerable.
We're in Kentucky to tell Mitch McConnell: do not take health care from 22 million to give tax cuts to billionaires. https://t.co/lFy2j2md95
How could it be that @SenateMajLdr could be working so hard to destroy legislation which benefited his own state more than any other?

What the Russians did in the 2016 election cycle deserves unconditional condemnation. That includes all of their conduct - whether it was active support of any candidate or active opposition to any candidate.
"As someone who campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton from one end of this country to another, it is an outrage that she had to run against not only Donald Trump but also the Russian government."
"The key issues now are:

1) How we prevent the unwitting manipulation of our electoral and political system by foreign governments.
2) Exposing who was actively consorting with the Russian government’s attack on our democracy."
Mueller's indictment provides further evidence that the Russian government interfered in 2016. It also shows that they tried to turn my supporters against Hillary Clinton in the primary and general election. I unequivocally condemn such interference.

"No, Donald Trump, the economy is not “absolutely booming” when nearly 80% of workers live paycheck to paycheck – hoping that they don’t get sick or that their car doesn’t break down."
"Together, we must fight for a society that works for all Americans, not just the wealthy few. We must fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice, not unbridled greed."
"We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans go without food, housing, and health care. It’s about time we got our national priorities right. https://t.co/L4vy5kjC1B"
‘This strike is a strike to save public education.’ — Here’s why Los Angeles teachers are striking in their own words https://t.co/Ht9LopLkDE
Let’s show the @UTLAnow teachers we stand with them in their struggle. Donate $27 today to their solidarity strike fund: https://t.co/p5itUGqPh9 https://t.co/IJkvMkYVkw
"How is it that the billionaires of this country get huge tax breaks, but our teachers and children get broken chairs, flooded classrooms and inadequate support staff in their schools? That is what a rigged economy looks like."
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, Trump’s policies are moving this country in exactly the wrong direction. Over 83% of the benefits of Trump’s tax plan is going to the top 1%. https://t.co/Pjbvsg9fXh"
How is it that the top 25 hedge fund managers in this country make more money than the combined salaries of every kindergarten teacher? We have got to get our priorities right.
"What I’ve learned from the labor movement is that one worker alone can beg for a wage, decent working conditions and retirement benefits, but when people stand together they don’t have to beg. They can win what they rightfully deserve. There is power in a union."
"Today, in America, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings – zero. That is unacceptable. We must create an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few."
No other country allows pharmaceutical companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want. The greed of the prescription drug industry is literally killing Americans and it has got to stop. https://t.co/bqh4wyw6Eg
"Instead of austerity programs for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations. We must demand that they pay their fair share in taxes. https://t.co/rGj5p6CiIF"
"If Trump wants to talk about crises, why don’t we look at the massive levels of income and wealth inequality. Or the 30 million Americans who have no health insurance and millions more who cannot afford the medicine they need.

Grow up, do your job, end this shutdown."

"Today we are here, not just to remember and honor Dr. King. We  are here  to fulfill his revolutionary spirit, to have the courage to take on the economic and political establishment and to create the kind of nation we know we can become."
"In 1963, I had the honor of attending Dr. King's March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

56 years after that march, many of the demands being made then are still being fought for today.

Let’s work together and, in the spirit of Dr. King, get it done. https://t.co/f17AHBDaHj"
We can and must end the pollution that disproportionately poisons the poor and people of color. We must move forward towards a jobs guarantee and a Green New Deal.
"In my view, not only do we have to expand primary health care and build more community health centers, but we need to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right – through a Medicare for all, single-payer program."
"Racial equality must be central to combatting economic inequality, if we are to build an economy that works for all of us, and not just the top 1%."
"Dr. King taught us that the “inseparable twin of racial injustice is economic injustice.” He taught us that we had to fight against three major evils – “the evil of racism, the evil of poverty and the evil of war.” #MLKDay"

You are most welcome @BernieSanders  and Thank You for being “A Power for Good!” https://t.co/CzPim9tklG
The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma helped cause the opioid crisis through aggressive marketing and lobbying of the opioid painkiller OxyContin. We must hold the pharmaceutical companies and executives that created the opioid crisis accountable. https://t.co/0IO5K3unQ5
"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and creating good paying jobs, we have to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country. We must make it easier, not harder, for workers to join unions. https://t.co/cmWRYgXH1q"
"We don’t need to create artificial crises like this government shutdown. We have enough real ones. Mr. President, end the crisis you created. End the shutdown."
Correction: more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings.
"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations, we must create the best public educational system in the world. Instead of major increases in military spending, we must invest in our kids."
"We have a dysfunctional childcare system in this country, which is too expensive for parents, while providers are paid totally inadequate wages. We need to do what other countries around the world do – develop a high quality universal child care program."
"In the twenty-first century, a public education system that goes from early childhood education through high school is not good enough. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free."
"Real and fundamental change never comes from the top on down. It’s never given to anybody. It always comes from the bottom on up, from grassroots activism, from millions of people standing up and fighting for justice."
"One of the major, untold stories of our time is the rapid movement toward global oligarchy. It is not acceptable that the top 1% of the world’s population owns half the planet’s wealth, while the bottom 70% of the working age population accounts for just 2.7% of global wealth."
"Big Pharma is one of the wealthiest and most powerful political forces in this country. If the pharmaceutical industry will not end its greed, which is literally killing Americans, then we will end it for them."
"We must recommit ourselves to bringing all people together in the fight for a just and humane world. When we stand together, we can win."
"The U.S. Senate and House must reassert its constitutional authority and finally end our support for the unauthorized, unconstitutional, and catastrophic Saudi-led war in Yemen so we can focus on humanitarian aid and a diplomatic solution."
"For every white male dollar:
- Asian American women earn 87 cents
- White women earn 79 cents
- Black women earn 63 cents
- Native American women earn 58 cents
- Latina women earn 54 cents

Pay equity among men and women workers should be established by LAW."
"We must repeal Citizens United, move to public funding of elections and end voter suppression and gerrymandering.

Our goal: establish a political system that has the highest voter turnout in the world and is governed by the democratic principle ‘one person - one vote.’"

"Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a blistering letter to a pharmaceutical company on Monday, demanding answers about its decision to charge $375,000 for a formerly low-cost drug and calling it corporate greed at its worst https://t.co/3Gf1KvUvNK"
"Nearly 85 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. The time is long overdue for us to create an economy that works for all Americans, not just the people on top."
"At a time of huge income and wealth inequality, Americans should be outraged that profitable corporations are laying off workers while spending billions of dollars to boost their stock’s value to further enrich the wealthy few."
"A $15 minimum wage was once considered ""radical"" – but working people organized, and today, members of Congress led by @SenSanders reintroduced the Federal #RaiseTheWage Act, which would mean raises in pay for more than 41 million of us nationwide.

Together, we will win. https://t.co/ec3AzfkzaP"
"The mark of a great nation is judged not by how many tax breaks it can give to billionaires, but by how it treats its most vulnerable people."
"While the ruling class may have the money, we have something that is even more powerful on our side – the people. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent."
"At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman’s right to choose, it is incredibly important that we fight to make sure that every woman in this country has the right to control her own body."
"Medicare for all is a struggle not just about health care, but about the heart and soul of our country — about what we stand for as a people. And it is a struggle that we are going to win."
"When people tell us the only thing that we can get is incremental health care change, we will tell them “no thanks.” We’re thinking big and demanding fundamental change on this issue."
"With Medicare for All, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment. That freedom would mean American workers would no longer have to choose between bargaining for higher wages or better health insurance."
"We must recognize the collective power of the labor movement to demand and win respect and equity for workers across the country. When we stand together, we can win."
"I stand with the Denver teachers. Public education is fundamental to any functioning democratic society, and teaching is one of its most valuable and indispensable professions. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity.  #DenverTeacherStrike"
"In a society with our resources, it is unconscionable that we do not properly invest in our children from the very first stages of their lives. We need universal, publicly funded childcare."
"Enough is enough. We have to summon the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry. We must accelerate our transition to clean energy, and finally put people before the profits of polluters."
"We must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth, the only one, which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave, paid sick time and paid vacation time."
"When it comes to taking on the imminent threat of climate change, we cannot think small. We must enact bold solutions to save our planet from the disastrous effects of climate change by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs."
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. It must be raised to $15 an hour and indexed to median wage growth thereafter. Doing so would give more than 40 million Americans a raise.
"If we are going to successfully combat climate change, we must have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry which is driving this crisis—as well as well as the politicians who have been bought off and refuse to do anything to address it."
"Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because, unlike other countries, the United States doesn’t directly regulate the price of medicine. That’s why I introduced the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act to rein in the greed of Big Pharma."
We cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us about twice as much per capita as any other major country and leaves nearly 30 million Americans uninsured. We must guarantee health care for everyone through a Medicare for All program.
"A moral society does not give tax breaks to billionaires, and then cut back on the needs of struggling seniors or people with disabilities. We must get our priorities straight and expand Social Security."
"There is something profoundly wrong when one family in our country, the Walton family, owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the rich and powerful."
Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation’s history. We must expand it so that every American can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.
The Walton family makes more money in one minute than Walmart workers do in an entire year. This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy.
"In the richest nation in the history of the world, it's a moral and political failing that nearly 30 million Americans don’t have health insurance. We must go forward to finally guarantee health care for all as a right through a Medicare for All, single-payer program."
"Since the Parkland shooting one year ago, nearly 1,200 American kids have been killed by guns. This is an epidemic that has got to be stopped.

We must follow the lead of the young activists who have bravely stood up to the NRA, and pass commonsense gun safety legislation."
"When we organize and stand together, we can win. Congratulations to @DenverTeachers on their hard fought victory. https://t.co/4Wg1BaA0by"
"The top 10 corporate executives in America saw their combined compensation skyrocket to $1.8 billion in 2017. Ten people.

Meanwhile we have 40 million people living in poverty. That kind of inequality should not exist in a modern society."
"Those who think universal health care is a fantasy might want to learn about Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, U.K. and many other countries who have made health care a right."
"We must do everything that we can to preserve American democracy and oppose the current drift toward authoritarianism that I believe Trump represents.

Those of us who believe in democracy and that our government must be accountable to its people must stand up and fight back."
"At a time when half of older Americans over the age of 55 have no retirement savings, our job is to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity they have earned and everyone with a disability can live with the security they need."
"In the last year, more American workers went on strike than in any year in nearly 3 decades.

When we stand together and fight, we can accomplish anything. We can transform this country from the bottom on up."

Wow. Crowd (of mostly college kids) in Iowa City goes absolutely nuts when @BernieSanders discusses abortion and says the federal govt has no business meddling in women's health. It also happens to be International Women's Day.
"Sanders' biggest applause line of the night is his pledge that, when he's president, ""we will protect a woman's right to control her own body."" Sparks chants of ""Bernie, Bernie!"""
"I’m at a @BernieSanders’ rally in Des Moines, Iowa. It’s early and a rainy morning but people have still come out to see the senator from Vermont. More to come! https://t.co/qPHIGx2WtI"
We're live in Des Moines! Thank you Iowa for being a part of the revolution to transform America. https://t.co/FSaeye81H8
The crowd has assembled at the Paul R. Knapp Animal Learning Center on the fairgrounds for @BernieSanders. #iacaucus https://t.co/8VMtMYfGLN
"In 2015 we were told our ideas were too radical and we were polling at 3% in Iowa.

In 2016 we won 50% of the vote in Iowa. Today, our ideas are mainstream and supported by a majority of Americans.

Now it’s time to complete the revolution we started. https://t.co/arpdlBx6sK"
".@BernieSanders: ""Well I don’t come from a billionaire family ... my family knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheck. I know where I come from."""
"In 2017, the top 65 health care CEOs made $1.7 billion in compensation. $1.7 billion.

Our dollars should go toward disease prevention, doctors, nurses, dentists and rural clinics—not toward making insurance companies and their CEOs super rich."
Another packed room for @BernieSanders for his 3rd rally on this Iowa trip. He held a very large event in this same room I believe a few weeks out from the #IACaucus. Crowd today is just as big if not bigger if I recall correctly https://t.co/cgkTgywDIV

Let me say to the pharmaceutical industry: you can spend all the money you want on 30-second ads against us. You can do all the lying you want. But we are going to lower prescription drug costs in this country. You’re going to stop ripping off the American people.

"Democracy is about serious debate over public policy, not having a president who is a pathological liar and who has told thousands of blatant lies since he has been in office."
"Our democracy is under attack by Donald Trump, who is intent on emulating authoritarian leaders in Russia, Saudi Arabia and North Korea.

There is a great struggle taking place between growing authoritarianism and democracy, and Trump is consistently on the wrong side."

"Donald Trump and his administration are actively involved in voter suppression. Our job is to make it easier for people to vote, not harder."
"The powerful special interests who control this country are going to spend a lot of money to try to defeat us. But we have something they don’t have: the power of the people.

They understand that. When we talk about the 1%, they are 1%. We are the 99%."
"The big money interests have incredible wealth. They have incredible power. But at the end of the day, they are just the 1%.

We are the 99%. We have the people. https://t.co/HCzPQ1riJR"
"At a time when the U.S. already spends more on the military than the next 10 countries combined, Trump is proposing an $861 billion increase in base defense spending over 10 years.

For the same cost, we could make public colleges and universities tuition-free for a decade."
"Trump’s budget cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare and $25 billion from Social Security.

Make no mistake about it: Trump’s budget is a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations in America."
"Trump's weakening of the State Dept, whose budget he now wants to cut by 23%, is extremely dangerous. Our diplomats do the hard work every day of advancing US interests and security. When we are in the White House we’ll make sure they get the support they need to keep us safe."
"At a time when climate change is already causing devastating harm, the mainstream media coverage of climate change actually decreased by 45% in 2018. That is a disgrace. https://t.co/pWTOnB6iyA"

"At a time when we Americans have a total of $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, it is insane that Trump’s budget would cut $207 billion from college affordability programs over 10 years and eliminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program."

"President Trump. You're not smarter than 99% of climate scientists who agree that climate change is not a hoax. It is not ""fake news."" It is real and will devastate millions. We are going to defeat you and move aggressively to address this crisis."
"Health Care Service Corp. made $4.1 billion in profits last year.

"Today 46% of all new income goes to the top 1%. Millions of Americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs just to survive. Over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck. And 3 people own as much wealth as the bottom 50%.

We won't accept a rigged economy any longer."
"U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen has not been authorized by Congress. It is unconstitutional. And it is contributing to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

Today the Senate must exercise its power and vote to remove the U.S. from this war in Yemen."
"It is Congress who decides if and when the U.S. goes to war, not the president. For far too long Congress has abdicated that responsibility. Today that must end. Today the Senate must vote to stop supporting the Saudi-led war in Yemen, where 85,000 children have starved to death."
How can we call this a civilized society when some Americans have access to the best medical care in the world and others are unable to walk into a doctor’s office because they lack money?
"I'm running for president because we can no longer tolerate a situation where the rich get the medical attention they need in order to stay alive, while members of working-class families have to die, needlessly suffer or go hopelessly into debt to get the care they need."

I do not want our children and grandchildren to look back on our actions today and ask why we didn't do everything we could to address climate change. We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and pass a Green New Deal.

Hello Charleston. @BernieSanders https://t.co/dbtEtfGOTW
"Our thoughts are with the victims of the horrific attack in Christchurch, New Zealand. No one should have to fear for their life because of their religion. We must come together to condemn all forms of hate and violence to build a future of respect and understanding."
We must build an international movement to take on the fossil fuel industry and leave a planet that is healthy and habitable for future generations. Today the young people of the #YouthClimateStrike are leading the way. Thank you for your courage.
It is not a radical idea to say that people ought to have clean drinking water when they turn on their taps. Today we say to the American people that we will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.

"Our campaign is about fundamentally ending the disparity of wealth, income and power in this country. But as we do that, we must also address the disparity within the disparity—the outrageous levels of racial disparity that currently exist."
"Unlike Trump, I did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every single year starting at the age of 3. As I recall, my allowance was 25 cents a week. https://t.co/ibN2E7xbMc"
What I mean by democratic socialism is that I want a vibrant democracy. Trump is actively involved in voter suppression and trying to keep people of color or low-income people from voting. I want to make it easier to vote.
"Trump in 2015:
""I was the first &amp; only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid.""

Trump's proposed budget:
-Cuts Social Security by $25 billion
-Cuts Medicare by $845 billion
-Cuts Medicaid by nearly $1.5 trillion"

There it is. The Trump administration just made it clear: they have no intention to protect the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. They want to throw millions of Americans off health insurance and put lives at risk. We will fight back. https://t.co/oXp6wlHpvL
Love will conquer hate. https://t.co/xYV1CpPpe9
Our goal is to pass Medicare for All and make health care a right. Today our job is to defend the Affordable Care Act from relentless attacks by the Trump administration.
"Trump promised, ""We're going to have insurance for everybody."" Now he is trying to throw tens of millions of Americans OFF of the health insurance they have.

Enough. We must defend the ACA and move forward to pass Medicare for All. https://t.co/Q3Dm6acn93"
"This is so beautiful. WATCH THIS.

The most touching, inspirational, transparent video I think I’ve ever seen from @BernieSanders.

Here he not only spends time with Muslims across the country, but directly addresses bigotry and expresses how he understands the pain they feel. https://t.co/33TFD2CFbu"
"The Republican Party is the party of:

-Throwing 32 million off of health insurance
-Removing pre-existing condition protections
-Blocking Medicaid expansion
-Defunding Planned Parenthood
-Cutting Medicare and Medicaid

Our job: pass Medicare for All. Make health care a right. https://t.co/bg25yQd4Ib"
"New Zealand took less than a week to ban military-style weapons after the Christchurch mosque attacks.

It has been 405 days since Parkland.

It has been 2,293 days since Sandy Hook.

It is past time that we take on the NRA and pass gun safety legislation."
"Trump and the Republican Party have chosen to stand with private health insurers and help them make as much profit as possible.

I stand with the American people, who deserve to get the health care they need regardless of whether they can afford it. #MedicareForAll"
"We must defend the ACA from Trump’s assault and protect people's existing coverage. However, protecting the ACA will not fully solve the health care crisis. To finally guarantee health care as a right, we must take on the insurance industry and pass a Medicare for All bill."
You're damn right. https://t.co/5lo87WKS60
Trump and DeVos want to slash education spending and defund the Special Olympics after giving tax breaks to the top 1%. Unbelievable. When we are in the White House we will get our national priorities straight. https://t.co/b1qpE9SA2t
This is a victory for thousands of workers who have stood up to massive corporations and organized for years. We will keep fighting until @McDonalds workers and all others are paid a living wage of at least $15 an hour. https://t.co/wmOcDmyLrh
"Después del horrible tiroteo en Nueva Zelandia, debemos unirnos para mostrar al mundo que el amor conquistará el odio. https://t.co/NuefLQjC6K"
"We have a chance to make history by reaching 1 million contributions by Sunday's fundraising deadline. Doing so would leave no doubt that ours is the largest, strongest grassroots campaign capable of beating Trump. Please help us get there:

"More than 8 million workers would lose out on overtime pay under Trump's proposed rollbacks of worker protections.

Unlike Trump, I know what it is like for a family to live paycheck to paycheck. When we are in the White House we will expand overtime protections."
"When we talk about investing in our people, we hear, ""How are you going to pay for that?” Yet the cost of our endless wars will soon surpass $6 trillion. Imagine if we invested $6 trillion in health care, education, housing, our infrastructure and much more. We must do better."
"My hope is that when future historians look back at our time, they will see how regular people came together to build a desperately-needed movement to reverse the drift toward oligarchy. That is what this campaign is all about."
"An ex-lobbyist for a drug company that charged $1,000 for one pill is behind Trump's new plan to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This is""draining the swamp""?

We will defend the ACA and finally put people before profits by moving to Medicare for all. https://t.co/jmnyzPeKCI"
"We are not going to let fossil fuel companies put their short-term profits ahead of the well-being of our planet, our kids and our grandkids. I'm proud that our campaign is taking the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge. https://t.co/c8VVcNKx9u"
Medicare for All is about freedom. People cannot truly be free unless they can get the health care they need. @RoKhanna https://t.co/pcpdSKUm2C
"In 2016 we reached 1 million contributions to our campaign in six months.

This time, we're trying to do it in six weeks.

Will you help us reach this unprecedented milestone and show we're the strongest grassroots campaign to take on Trump? https://t.co/xU8FtOMwBQ"
I think this is exactly right. This is about liberating millions of Americans. #MedicareForAll @SenSanders @RoKhanna https://t.co/SB2czjN4ym
"Sen. @BernieSanders writes in a guest column that he'll strengthen anti-trust laws and again allow farmers to sue ""big corporate middlemen"" if he's elected president. https://t.co/rkcq5V9ojB"
"Three years ago, we were told that Medicare for all was ""too radical."" Well, three years have come and gone, and a majority of Democratic voters in swing districts across the nation support Medicare for all. It's time to implement the political revolution we've been fighting for. https://t.co/NfwnHRfFK8"
"Just a few years ago we were told a $15 an hour was “too radical.” Well, today, Maryland became the sixth state to send the loud and clear message that a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it.

We're not done. Next we will pass a national $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/lSOMcBwLfX"
You know what would scare the hell out of Trump? One million grassroots contributions to our campaign. Help us get there by our deadline Sunday: https://t.co/vx9Mi4UCPV https://t.co/GPVpgaXj4h
